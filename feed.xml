&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="LifWor"&gt;1. Life and works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Immanuel Kant was born April 22, 1724 in Königsberg, near the
southeastern shore of the Baltic Sea. Today Königsberg has been
renamed Kaliningrad and is part of Russia. But during Kant’s lifetime
Königsberg was the capital of East Prussia, and its dominant
language was German. Though geographically remote from the rest of
Prussia and other German cities, Königsberg was then a major
commercial center, an important military port, and a relatively
cosmopolitan university
 town.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Kant was born into an artisan family of modest means. His father was
a master harness maker, and his mother was the daughter of a harness
maker, though she was better educated than most women of her social
class. Kant’s family was never destitute, but his father’s trade was in
decline during Kant’s youth and his parents at times had to rely on
extended family for financial support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Kant’s parents were Pietist and he attended a Pietist school, the
Collegium Fridericianum, from ages eight through fifteen. Pietism was
an evangelical Lutheran movement that emphasized conversion, reliance
on divine grace, the experience of religious emotions, and personal
devotion involving regular Bible study, prayer, and
introspection. Kant reacted strongly against the forced soul-searching
to which he was subjected at the Collegium Fridericianum, in response
to which he sought refuge in the Latin classics, which were central to
the school’s curriculum. Later the mature Kant’s emphasis on reason
and autonomy, rather than emotion and dependence on either authority
or grace, may in part reflect his youthful reaction against
Pietism. But although the young Kant loathed his Pietist schooling, he
had deep respect and admiration for his parents, especially his
mother, whose “genuine religiosity” he described as
“not at all enthusiastic.” According to his biographer,
Manfred Kuehn, Kant’s parents probably influenced him much less
through their Pietism than through their artisan values of “hard
work, honesty, cleanliness, and independence,” which they taught
him by example.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Kant attended college at the University of Königsberg, known as
the Albertina, where his early interest in classics was quickly
superseded by philosophy, which all first year students studied and
which encompassed mathematics and physics as well as logic,
metaphysics, ethics, and natural law. Kant’s philosophy professors
exposed him to the approach of Christian Wolff (1679–1750), whose
critical synthesis of the philosophy of G. W. Leibniz (1646–1716) was
then very influential in German universities. But Kant was also exposed
to a range of German and British critics of Wolff, and there were
strong doses of Aristotelianism and Pietism represented in the
philosophy faculty as well. Kant’s favorite teacher was Martin Knutzen
(1713–1751), a Pietist who was heavily influenced by both Wolff and the
English philosopher John Locke (1632–1704). Knutzen introduced Kant to
the work of Isaac Newton (1642–1727), and his influence is visible in
Kant’s first published work, &lt;em&gt;Thoughts on the True Estimation of Living
Forces&lt;/em&gt; (1747), which was a critical attempt to mediate a dispute in
natural philosophy between Leibnizians and Newtonians over the proper
measurement of force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After college Kant spent six years as a private tutor to young children
outside Königsberg. By this time both of his parents had died and
Kant’s finances were not yet secure enough for him to pursue an
academic career. He finally returned to Königsberg in 1754 and
began teaching at the Albertina the following year. For the next four
decades Kant taught philosophy there, until his retirement from
teaching in 1796 at the age of seventy-two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant had a burst of publishing activity in the years after he returned
from working as a private tutor. In 1754 and 1755 he published three
scientific works – one of which, &lt;em&gt;Universal Natural History and Theory
of the Heavens&lt;/em&gt; (1755), was a major book in which, among other things,
he developed what later became known as the nebular hypothesis about
the formation of the solar system. Unfortunately, the printer went
bankrupt and the book had little immediate impact. To secure
qualifications for teaching at the university, Kant also wrote two
Latin dissertations: the first, entitled &lt;em&gt;Concise Outline of Some
Reflections on Fire&lt;/em&gt; (1755), earned him the Magister degree; and the
second, &lt;em&gt;New Elucidation of the First Principles of Metaphysical
Cognition&lt;/em&gt; (1755), entitled him to teach as an unsalaried lecturer. The
following year he published another Latin work, &lt;em&gt;The Employment in
Natural Philosophy of Metaphysics Combined with Geometry, of Which
Sample I Contains the Physical Monadology&lt;/em&gt; (1756), in hopes of
succeeding Knutzen as associate professor of logic and metaphysics,
though Kant failed to secure this position. Both the &lt;em&gt;New Elucidation&lt;/em&gt;,
which was Kant’s first work concerned mainly with metaphysics, and the
&lt;em&gt;Physical Monadology&lt;/em&gt; further develop the position on the interaction of
finite substances that he first outlined in &lt;em&gt;Living Forces&lt;/em&gt;. Both works
depart from Leibniz-Wolffian views, though not radically. The &lt;em&gt;New
Elucidation&lt;/em&gt; in particular shows the influence of Christian August
Crusius (1715–1775), a German critic of
 Wolff.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

As an unsalaried lecturer at the Albertina Kant was paid directly by
the students who attended his lectures, so he needed to teach an
enormous amount and to attract many students in order to earn a living.
Kant held this position from 1755 to 1770, during which period he would
lecture an average of twenty hours per week on logic, metaphysics, and
ethics, as well as mathematics, physics, and physical geography. In his
lectures Kant used textbooks by Wolffian authors such as Alexander
Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714–1762) and Georg Friedrich Meier (1718–1777),
but he followed them loosely and used them to structure his own
reflections, which drew on a wide range of ideas of contemporary
interest. These ideas often stemmed from British sentimentalist
philosophers such as David Hume (1711–1776) and Francis Hutcheson
(1694–1747), some of whose texts were translated into German in the
mid-1750s; and from the Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau
(1712–1778), who published a flurry of works in the early 1760s. From
early in his career Kant was a popular and successful lecturer. He also
quickly developed a local reputation as a promising young intellectual
and cut a dashing figure in Königsberg society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After several years of relative quiet, Kant unleashed another burst of
publications in 1762–1764, including five philosophical works. &lt;em&gt;The
False Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic Figures&lt;/em&gt; (1762) rehearses
criticisms of Aristotelian logic that were developed by other German
philosophers. &lt;em&gt;The Only Possible Argument in Support of a Demonstration
of the Existence of God&lt;/em&gt; (1762–3) is a major book in which Kant drew on
his earlier work in &lt;em&gt;Universal History&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;New Elucidation&lt;/em&gt; to develop an
original argument for God’s existence as a condition of the internal
possibility of all things, while criticizing other arguments for God’s
existence. The book attracted several positive and some negative
reviews. In 1762 Kant also submitted an essay entitled &lt;em&gt;Inquiry
Concerning the Distinctness of the Principles of Natural Theology and
Morality&lt;/em&gt; to a prize competition by the Prussian Royal Academy, though
Kant’s submission took second prize to Moses Mendelssohn’s winning
essay (and was published with it in 1764). Kant’s &lt;em&gt;Prize Essay&lt;/em&gt;, as it is
known, departs more significantly from Leibniz-Wolffian views than his
earlier work and also contains his first extended discussion of moral
philosophy in print. The &lt;em&gt;Prize Essay&lt;/em&gt; draws on British sources to
criticize German rationalism in two respects: first, drawing on Newton,
Kant distinguishes between the methods of mathematics and philosophy;
and second, drawing on Hutcheson, he claims that “an unanalysable
feeling of the good” supplies the material content of our moral
obligations, which cannot be demonstrated in a purely intellectual way
from the formal principle of perfection alone
 (2:299).&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; 
 These themes
reappear in the &lt;em&gt;Attempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Magnitudes
into Philosophy&lt;/em&gt; (1763), whose main thesis, however, is that the real
opposition of conflicting forces, as in causal relations, is not
reducible to the logical relation of contradiction, as Leibnizians
held. In &lt;em&gt;Negative Magnitudes&lt;/em&gt; Kant also argues that the morality of an
action is a function of the internal forces that motivate one to act,
rather than of the external (physical) actions or their consequences.
Finally, &lt;em&gt;Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and the Sublime&lt;/em&gt;
(1764) deals mainly with alleged differences in the tastes of men and
women and of people from different cultures. After it was published,
Kant filled his own interleaved copy of this book with (often
unrelated) handwritten remarks, many of which reflect the deep
influence of Rousseau on his thinking about moral philosophy in the
mid-1760s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These works helped to secure Kant a broader reputation in Germany, but
for the most part they were not strikingly original. Like other German
philosophers at the time, Kant’s early works are generally concerned
with using insights from British empiricist authors to reform or
broaden the German rationalist tradition without radically undermining
its foundations. While some of his early works tend to emphasize
rationalist ideas, others have a more empiricist emphasis. During this
time Kant was striving to work out an independent position, but before
the 1770s his views remained fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 1766 Kant published his first work concerned with the possibility of
metaphysics, which later became a central topic of his mature
philosophy. &lt;em&gt;Dreams of a Spirit-Seer Elucidated by Dreams of
Metaphysics&lt;/em&gt;, which he wrote soon after publishing a short &lt;em&gt;Essay on
Maladies of the Mind&lt;/em&gt; (1764), was occasioned by Kant’s fascination with
the Swedish visionary Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), who claimed to
have insight into a spirit world that enabled him to make a series of
apparently miraculous predictions. In this curious work Kant
satirically compares Swedenborg’s spirit-visions to the belief of
rationalist metaphysicians in an immaterial soul that survives death,
and he concludes that philosophical knowledge of either is impossible
because human reason is limited to experience. The skeptical tone of
Dreams is tempered, however, by Kant’s suggestion that “moral faith”
nevertheless supports belief in an immaterial and immortal soul, even
if it is not possible to attain metaphysical knowledge in this domain
(2:373).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 1770, at the age of forty-six, Kant was appointed to the chair in
logic and metaphysics at the Albertina, after teaching for fifteen
years as an unsalaried lecturer and working since 1766 as a
sublibrarian to supplement his income. Kant was turned down for the
same position in 1758. But later, as his reputation grew, he declined
chairs in philosophy at Erlangen (1769) and Jena (1770) in hopes of
obtaining one in Königsberg. After Kant was finally promoted, he
gradually extended his repertoire of lectures to include anthropology
(Kant’s was the first such course in Germany and became very popular),
rational theology, pedagogy, natural right, and even mineralogy and
military fortifications. In order to inaugurate his new position, Kant
also wrote one more Latin dissertation: &lt;em&gt;Concerning the Form and
Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World&lt;/em&gt; (1770), which is
known as the &lt;em&gt;Inaugural Dissertation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;Inaugural Dissertation&lt;/em&gt; departs more radically from both Wolffian
rationalism and British sentimentalism than Kant’s earlier work.
Inspired by Crusius and the Swiss natural philosopher Johann Heinrich
Lambert (1728–1777), Kant distinguishes between two fundamental
powers of cognition, sensibility and understanding (intelligence),
where the Leibniz-Wolffians regarded understanding (intellect) as the
only fundamental power. Kant therefore rejects the rationalist view
that sensibility is only a confused species of intellectual cognition,
and he replaces this with his own view that sensibility is distinct
from understanding and brings to perception its own subjective forms
of space and time – a view that developed out of Kant’s earlier
criticism of Leibniz’s relational view of space in &lt;em&gt;Concerning the
Ultimate Ground of the Differentiation of Directions in Space&lt;/em&gt; (1768).
Moreover, as the title of the &lt;em&gt;Inaugural Dissertation&lt;/em&gt; indicates, Kant
argues that sensibility and understanding are directed at two
different worlds: sensibility gives us access to the sensible world,
while understanding enables us to grasp a distinct intelligible
world. These two worlds are related in that what the understanding
grasps in the intelligible world is the “paradigm” of
“NOUMENAL PERFECTION,” which is “a common measure
for all other things in so far as they are realities.”
Considered theoretically, this intelligible paradigm of perfection is
God; considered practically, it is “MORAL PERFECTION”
(2:396). The &lt;em&gt;Inaugural Dissertation&lt;/em&gt; thus develops a form of Platonism;
and it rejects the view of British sentimentalists that moral
judgments are based on feelings of pleasure or pain, since Kant now
holds that moral judgments are based on pure understanding alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After 1770 Kant never surrendered the views that sensibility and
understanding are distinct powers of cognition, that space and time are
subjective forms of human sensibility, and that moral judgments are
based on pure understanding (or reason) alone. But his embrace of
Platonism in the &lt;em&gt;Inaugural Dissertation&lt;/em&gt; was short-lived. He soon denied
that our understanding is capable of insight into an intelligible
world, which cleared the path toward his mature position in the
&lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt; (1781), according to which the understanding
(like sensibility) supplies forms that structure our experience of the
sensible world, to which human knowledge is limited, while the
intelligible (or noumenal) world is strictly unknowable to us. Kant
spent a decade working on the &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt; and published
nothing else of significance between 1770 and 1781. But its publication
marked the beginning of another burst of activity that produced Kant’s
most important and enduring works. Because early reviews of the
&lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt; were few and (in Kant’s judgment)
uncomprehending, he tried to clarify its main points in the much
shorter &lt;em&gt;Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Come
Forward as a Science&lt;/em&gt; (1783). Among the major books that rapidly
followed are the &lt;em&gt;Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals&lt;/em&gt; (1785), Kant’s
main work on the fundamental principle of morality; the &lt;em&gt;Metaphysical
Foundations of Natural Science&lt;/em&gt; (1786), his main work on natural
philosophy in what scholars call his critical period (1781–1798); the
second and substantially revised edition of the &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt;
(1787); the &lt;em&gt;Critique of Practical Reason&lt;/em&gt; (1788), a fuller discussion of
topics in moral philosophy that builds on (and in some ways revises)
the &lt;em&gt;Groundwork&lt;/em&gt;; and the &lt;em&gt;Critique of the Power of Judgment&lt;/em&gt; (1790), which
deals with aesthetics and teleology. Kant also published a number of
important essays in this period, including &lt;em&gt;Idea for a Universal History
With a Cosmopolitan Aim&lt;/em&gt; (1784) and &lt;em&gt;Conjectural Beginning of Human
History&lt;/em&gt; (1786), his main contributions to the philosophy of history; &lt;em&gt;An
Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment?&lt;/em&gt; (1784), which broaches
some of the key ideas of his later political essays; and &lt;em&gt;What Does it
Mean to Orient Oneself in Thinking?&lt;/em&gt; (1786), Kant’s intervention in the
pantheism controversy that raged in German intellectual circles after
F. H. Jacobi (1743–1819) accused the recently deceased G. E. Lessing
(1729–1781) of Spinozism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With these works Kant secured international fame and came to dominate
German philosophy in the late 1780s. But in 1790 he announced that the
&lt;em&gt;Critique of the Power of Judgment&lt;/em&gt; brought his critical enterprise to an
end (5:170). By then K. L. Reinhold (1758–1823), whose &lt;em&gt;Letters on the
Kantian Philosophy&lt;/em&gt; (1786) popularized Kant’s moral and religious ideas,
had been installed (in 1787) in a chair devoted to Kantian philosophy
at Jena, which was more centrally located than Königsberg and
rapidly developing into the focal point of the next phase in German
intellectual history. Reinhold soon began to criticize and move away
from Kant’s views. In 1794 his chair at Jena passed to J. G. Fichte,
who had visited the master in Königsberg and whose first book,
&lt;em&gt;Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation&lt;/em&gt; (1792), was published
anonymously and initially mistaken for a work by Kant himself. This
catapulted Fichte to fame, but soon he too moved away from Kant and
developed an original position quite at odds with Kant’s, which Kant
finally repudiated publicly in 1799 (12:370–371). Yet while German
philosophy moved on to assess and respond to Kant’s legacy, Kant
himself continued publishing important works in the 1790s. Among these
are &lt;em&gt;Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason&lt;/em&gt; (1793), which drew a
censure from the Prussian King when Kant published the book after its
second essay was rejected by the censor; &lt;em&gt;The Conflict of the Faculties&lt;/em&gt;
(1798), a collection of essays inspired by Kant’s troubles with the
censor and dealing with the relationship between the philosophical and
theological faculties of the university; &lt;em&gt;On the Common Saying: That May
be Correct in Theory, But it is of No Use in Practice&lt;/em&gt; (1793), &lt;em&gt;Toward
Perpetual Peace&lt;/em&gt; (1795), and the &lt;em&gt;Doctrine of Right&lt;/em&gt;, the first part of
&lt;em&gt;The Metaphysics of Morals&lt;/em&gt; (1797), Kant’s main works in political
philosophy; the &lt;em&gt;Doctrine of Virtue&lt;/em&gt;, the second part of &lt;em&gt;The Metaphysics
of Morals&lt;/em&gt; (1797), Kant’s most mature work in moral philosophy, which he had been planning for
more than thirty years; and &lt;em&gt;Anthropology From a Pragmatic Point of View&lt;/em&gt;
(1798), based on Kant’s anthropology lectures. Several other
compilations of Kant’s lecture notes from other courses were published
later, but these were not prepared by Kant himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant retired from teaching in 1796. For nearly two decades he had lived
a highly disciplined life focused primarily on completing his
philosophical system, which began to take definite shape in his mind
only in middle age. After retiring he came to believe that there was a
gap in this system separating the metaphysical foundations of natural
science from physics itself, and he set out to close this gap in a
series of notes that postulate the existence of an ether or caloric
matter. These notes, known as the &lt;em&gt;Opus Postumum&lt;/em&gt;, remained unfinished
and unpublished in Kant’s lifetime, and scholars disagree on their
significance and relation to his earlier work. It is clear, however,
that some of these late notes show unmistakable signs of Kant’s mental decline,
which became tragically precipitous around 1800. Kant died February 12,
1804, just short of his eightieth birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="KanProThePurRea"&gt;2. Kant’s project in the &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The main topic of the &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt; is the possibility of
metaphysics, understood in a specific way. Kant defines metaphysics in
terms of “the cognitions after which reason might strive
independently of all experience,” and his goal in the book is to
reach a “decision about the possibility or impossibility of a
metaphysics in general, and the determination of its sources, as well
as its extent and boundaries, all, however, from principles”
(Axii. See also Bxiv; and 4:255–257). Thus metaphysics for Kant
concerns a priori knowledge, or knowledge whose justification does not
depend on experience; and he associates a priori knowledge with reason.
The project of the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; is to examine whether, how, and to what
extent human reason is capable of a priori knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="CriEnl"&gt;2.1 The crisis of the Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

To understand the project of the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; better, let us consider
the historical and intellectual context in which it was
written.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; 
 Kant wrote the
&lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; toward the end of the Enlightenment, which was then in a state
of crisis. Hindsight enables us to see that the 1780’s was a
transitional decade in which the cultural balance shifted decisively
away from the Enlightenment toward Romanticism, but Kant did
not have the benefit of such hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Enlightenment was a reaction to the rise and successes of modern
science in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The spectacular
achievements of Newton in particular engendered widespread confidence
and optimism about the power of human reason to control nature and to
improve human life. One effect of this new confidence in reason was
that traditional authorities were increasingly questioned. Why
should we need political or religious authorities to tell us how to
live or what to believe, if each of us has the capacity to figure these
things out for ourselves? Kant expresses this Enlightenment commitment
to the sovereignty of reason in the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our age is the age of criticism, to which everything must submit.
Religion through its holiness and legislation through its majesty
commonly seek to exempt themselves from it. But in this way they excite
a just suspicion against themselves, and cannot lay claim to that
unfeigned respect that reason grants only to that which has been able
to withstand its free and public examination. (Axi)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Enlightenment is about thinking for oneself rather than letting others
think for you, according to &lt;em&gt;What is Enlightenment?&lt;/em&gt; (8:35). In this
essay, Kant also expresses the Enlightenment faith in the inevitability
of progress. A few independent thinkers will gradually inspire a
broader cultural movement, which ultimately will lead to greater
freedom of action and governmental reform. A culture of enlightenment
is “almost inevitable” if only there is “freedom to make public use of
one’s reason in all matters” (8:36).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problem is that to some it seemed unclear whether progress would in
fact ensue if reason enjoyed full sovereignty over traditional
authorities; or whether unaided reasoning would instead lead straight
to materialism, fatalism, atheism, skepticism (Bxxxiv), or even
libertinism and authoritarianism (8:146). The Enlightenment commitment
to the sovereignty of reason was tied to the expectation that it would
not lead to any of these consequences but instead would support certain
key beliefs that tradition had always sanctioned. Crucially, these
included belief in God, the soul, freedom, and the compatibility of
science with morality and religion. Although a few intellectuals
rejected some or all of these beliefs, the general spirit of the
Enlightenment was not so radical. The Enlightenment was about replacing
traditional authorities with the authority of individual human reason,
but it was not about overturning traditional moral and religious
beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yet the original inspiration for the Enlightenment was the new physics,
which was mechanistic. If nature is entirely governed by mechanistic,
causal laws, then it may seem that there is no room for freedom, a
soul, or anything but matter in motion. This threatened the traditional
view that morality requires freedom. We must be free in order to choose
what is right over what is wrong, because otherwise we cannot be held
responsible. It also threatened the traditional religious belief in a
soul that can survive death or be resurrected in an afterlife. So
modern science, the pride of the Enlightenment, the source of its
optimism about the powers of human reason, threatened to undermine
traditional moral and religious beliefs that free rational thought was
expected to support. This was the main intellectual crisis of the
Enlightenment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt; is Kant’s response to this crisis. Its main
topic is metaphysics because, for Kant, metaphysics is the domain of
reason – it is “the inventory of all we possess through pure
reason, ordered systematically” (Axx) – and the authority of
reason was in question. Kant’s main goal is to show that a critique of
reason by reason itself, unaided and unrestrained by traditional
authorities, establishes a secure and consistent basis for both
Newtonian science and traditional morality and religion. In other
words, free rational inquiry adequately supports all of these essential
human interests and shows them to be mutually consistent. So reason
deserves the sovereignty attributed to it by the Enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="KanCopRev"&gt;2.2 Kant’s Copernican revolution in philosophy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

To see how Kant attempts to achieve this goal in the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt;, it
helps to reflect on his grounds for rejecting the Platonism of the
&lt;em&gt;Inaugural Dissertation&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Inaugural Dissertation&lt;/em&gt; also tries
to reconcile Newtonian science with traditional morality and religion in a way,
but its strategy is different from that of the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt;. According to
the &lt;em&gt;Inaugural Dissertation&lt;/em&gt;, Newtonian science is true of the sensible
world, to which sensibility gives us access; and the understanding
grasps principles of divine and moral perfection in a distinct
intelligible world, which are paradigms for measuring everything in the
sensible world. So on this view our knowledge of the intelligible world
is a priori because it does not depend on sensibility, and this a
priori knowledge furnishes principles for judging the sensible world
because in some way the sensible world itself conforms to or imitates
the intelligible world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Soon after writing the &lt;em&gt;Inaugural Dissertation&lt;/em&gt;, however, Kant expressed
doubts about this view. As he explained in a February 21, 1772 letter
to his friend and former student, Marcus Herz:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In my dissertation I was content to explain the nature of
intellectual representations in a merely negative way, namely, to state
that they were not modifications of the soul brought about by the
object. However, I silently passed over the further question of how a
representation that refers to an object without being in any way
affected by it can be possible…. [B]y what means are these
[intellectual representations] given to us, if not by the way in which
they affect us? And if such intellectual representations depend on our
inner activity, whence comes the agreement that they are supposed to
have with objects – objects that are nevertheless not possibly
produced thereby?…[A]s to how my understanding may form for itself
concepts of things completely a priori, with which concepts the things
must necessarily agree, and as to how my understanding may formulate
real principles concerning the possibility of such concepts, with which
principles experience must be in exact agreement and which nevertheless
are independent of experience – this question, of how the faculty
of understanding achieves this conformity with the things themselves,
is still left in a state of obscurity. (10:130–131)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here Kant entertains doubts about how a priori knowledge of an
intelligible world would be possible. The position of the &lt;em&gt;Inaugural
Dissertation&lt;/em&gt; is that the intelligible world is independent of the human
understanding and of the sensible world, both of which (in different
ways) conform to the intelligible world. But, leaving aside questions
about what it means for the sensible world to conform to an
intelligible world, how is it possible for the human understanding to
conform to or grasp an intelligible world? If the intelligible world is
independent of our understanding, then it seems that we could grasp it
only if we are passively affected by it in some way. But for Kant
sensibility is our passive or receptive capacity to be affected by
objects that are independent of us (2:392, A51/B75). So the only way we
could grasp an intelligible world that is independent of us is through
sensibility, which means that our knowledge of it could not be a
priori. The pure understanding alone could at best enable us to form
representations of an intelligible world. But since these intellectual
representations would entirely “depend on our inner activity,” as Kant
says to Herz, we have no good reason to believe that they would conform to an
independent intelligible world. Such a priori intellectual
representations could well be figments of the brain that do not
correspond to anything independent of the human mind. In any case, it
is completely mysterious how there might come to be a correspondence
between purely intellectual representations and an independent
intelligible world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant’s strategy in the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; is similar to that of the &lt;em&gt;Inaugural
Dissertation&lt;/em&gt; in that both works attempt to reconcile modern science
with traditional morality and religion by relegating them to distinct
sensible and intelligible worlds, respectively. But the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; gives
a far more modest and yet revolutionary account of a priori knowledge.
As Kant’s letter to Herz suggests, the main problem with his view in
the &lt;em&gt;Inaugural Dissertation&lt;/em&gt; is that it tries to explain the possibility
of a priori knowledge about a world that is entirely independent of the
human mind. This turned out to be a dead end, and Kant never again
maintained that we can have a priori knowledge about an intelligible
world precisely because such a world would be entirely independent of
us. However, Kant’s revolutionary position in the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; is that we
can have a priori knowledge about the general structure of the sensible
world because it is not entirely independent of the human mind. The
sensible world, or the world of appearances, is constructed by the
human mind from a combination of sensory matter that we receive
passively and a priori forms that are supplied by our cognitive
faculties. We can have a priori knowledge only about aspects of the
sensible world that reflect the a priori forms supplied by our
cognitive faculties. In Kant’s words, “we can cognize of things a
priori only what we ourselves have put into them” (Bxviii). So
according to the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt;, a priori knowledge is possible only if and
to the extent that the sensible world itself depends on the way the
human mind structures its experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant characterizes this new constructivist view of experience in the
&lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; through an analogy with the revolution wrought by Copernicus
in astronomy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Up to now it has been assumed that all our cognition must
conform to the objects; but all attempts to find out something about
them a priori through concepts that would extend our cognition have, on
this presupposition, come to nothing. Hence let us once try whether we
do not get farther with the problems of metaphysics by assuming that
the objects must conform to our cognition, which would agree better
with the requested possibility of an a priori cognition of them, which
is to establish something about objects before they are given to us.
This would be just like the first thoughts of Copernicus, who, when he
did not make good progress in the explanation of the celestial motions
if he assumed that the entire celestial host revolves around the
observer, tried to see if he might not have greater success if he made
the observer revolve and left the stars at rest. Now in metaphysics we
can try in a similar way regarding the intuition of objects. If
intuition has to conform to the constitution of the objects, then I do
not see how we can know anything of them a priori; but if the object
(as an object of the senses) conforms to the constitution of our
faculty of intuition, then I can very well represent this possibility
to myself. Yet because I cannot stop with these intuitions, if they are
to become cognitions, but must refer them as representations to
something as their object and determine this object through them, I can
assume either that the concepts through which I bring about this
determination also conform to the objects, and then I am once again in
the same difficulty about how I could know anything about them a
priori, or else I assume that the objects, or what is the same thing,
the experience in which alone they can be cognized (as given objects)
conforms to those concepts, in which case I immediately see an easier
way out of the difficulty, since experience itself is a kind of
cognition requiring the understanding, whose rule I have to presuppose
in myself before any object is given to me, hence a priori, which rule
is expressed in concepts a priori, to which all objects of experience
must therefore necessarily conform, and with which they must
agree.  (Bxvi–xviii)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As this passage suggests, what Kant has changed in the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; is
primarily his view about the role and powers of the understanding,
since he already held in the &lt;em&gt;Inaugural Dissertation&lt;/em&gt; that sensibility
contributes the forms of space and time – which he calls pure (or a
priori) intuitions (2:397) – to our cognition of the sensible world.
But the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; claims that pure understanding too, rather than giving
us insight into an intelligible world, is limited to providing forms –
which he calls pure or a priori concepts – that structure our cognition
of the sensible world. So now both sensibility and understanding work
together to construct cognition of the sensible world, which therefore
conforms to the a priori forms that are supplied by our cognitive
faculties: the a priori intuitions of sensibility and the a priori
concepts of the understanding. This account is analogous to the
heliocentric revolution of Copernicus in astronomy because both require
contributions from the observer to be factored into explanations of
phenomena, although neither reduces phenomena to the contributions of
observers
 alone.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;
 The way celestial
phenomena appear to us on earth, according to Copernicus, is affected
by both the motions of celestial bodies and the motion of the earth,
which is not a stationary body around which everything else revolves.
For Kant, analogously, the phenomena of human experience depend on both
the sensory data that we receive passively through sensibility and the
way our mind actively processes this data according to its own a priori
rules. These rules supply the general framework in which the sensible
world and all the objects (or phenomena) in it appear to us. So the
sensible world and its phenomena are not entirely independent of the
human mind, which contributes its basic structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How does Kant’s Copernican revolution in philosophy improve on the
strategy of the &lt;em&gt;Inaugural Dissertation&lt;/em&gt; for reconciling modern science
with traditional morality and religion? First, it gives Kant a new and
ingenious way of placing modern science on an a priori foundation. He
is now in a position to argue that we can have a priori knowledge about
the basic laws of modern science because those laws reflect the human
mind’s contribution to structuring our experience. In other words, the
sensible world necessarily conforms to certain fundamental laws – such
as that every event has a cause – because the human mind constructs it
according to those laws. Moreover, we can identify those laws by
reflecting on the conditions of possible experience, which reveals that
it would be impossible for us to experience a world in which, for
example, any given event fails to have a cause. From this Kant
concludes that metaphysics is indeed possible in the sense that we can
have a priori knowledge that the entire sensible world – not just our
actual experience, but any possible human experience – necessarily
conforms to certain laws. Kant calls this immanent metaphysics or the
metaphysics of experience, because it deals with the essential
principles that are immanent to human experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But, second, if “we can cognize of things a priori only what we
ourselves have put into them,” then we cannot have a priori
knowledge about things whose existence and nature are entirely
independent of the human mind, which Kant calls things in themselves
(Bxviii). In his words: “[F]rom this deduction of our faculty of
cognizing a priori […] there emerges a very strange result […],
namely that with this faculty we can never get beyond the boundaries
of possible experience, […and] that such cognition reaches
appearances only, leaving the thing in itself as something actual for
itself but uncognized by us” (Bxix–xx). That is, Kant’s
constructivist foundation for scientific knowledge restricts science
to the realm of appearances and implies that transcendent metaphysics
– i.e., a priori knowledge of things in themselves that transcend
possible human experience – is impossible. In the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt;
Kant thus rejects the insight into an intelligible world that he
defended in the &lt;em&gt;Inaugural Dissertation&lt;/em&gt;, and he now claims that
rejecting knowledge about things in themselves is necessary for
reconciling science with traditional morality and religion. This is
because he claims that belief in God, freedom, and immortality have a
strictly moral basis, and yet adopting these beliefs on moral grounds
would be unjustified if we could know that they were
false. “Thus,” Kant says, “I had to deny knowledge
in order to make room for faith” (Bxxx). Restricting knowledge
to appearances and relegating God and the soul to an unknowable realm
of things in themselves guarantees that it is impossible to disprove
claims about God and the freedom or immortality of the soul, which
moral arguments may therefore justify us in believing. Moreover, the
determinism of modern science no longer threatens the freedom required
by traditional morality, because science and therefore determinism
apply only to appearances, and there is room for freedom in the realm
of things in themselves, where the self or soul is located. We cannot
know (theoretically) that we are free, because we cannot know anything
about things in themselves. But there are especially strong moral
grounds for the belief in human freedom, which acts as “the
keystone” supporting other morally grounded beliefs
(5:3–4). In this way, Kant replaces transcendent metaphysics
with a new practical science that he calls the metaphysics of
morals. It thus turns out that two kinds of metaphysics are possible:
the metaphysics of experience (or nature) and the metaphysics of
morals, both of which depend on Kant’s Copernican revolution in
philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="TraIde"&gt;3. Transcendental idealism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Perhaps the central and most controversial thesis of the &lt;em&gt;Critique of
Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt; is that human beings experience only appearances, not
things in themselves; and that space and time are only subjective forms
of human intuition that would not subsist in themselves if one were to
abstract from all subjective conditions of human intuition. Kant calls
this thesis transcendental
 idealism.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;
One of his best summaries of it is arguably the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have therefore wanted to say that all our intuition is nothing but
the representation of appearance; that the things that we intuit are
not in themselves what we intuit them to be, nor are their relations so
constituted in themselves as they appear to us; and that if we remove
our own subject or even only the subjective constitution of the senses
in general, then all constitution, all relations of objects in space
and time, indeed space and time themselves would disappear, and as
appearances they cannot exist in themselves, but only in us. What may
be the case with objects in themselves and abstracted from all this
receptivity of our sensibility remains entirely unknown to us. We are
acquainted with nothing except our way of perceiving them, which is
peculiar to us, and which therefore does not necessarily pertain to
every being, though to be sure it pertains to every human being. We are
concerned solely with this. Space and time are its pure forms,
sensation in general its matter. We can cognize only the former a
priori, i.e., prior to all actual perception, and they are therefore
called pure intuition; the latter, however, is that in our cognition
that is responsible for its being called a posteriori cognition, i.e.,
empirical intuition. The former adheres to our sensibility absolutely
necessarily, whatever sort of sensations we may have; the latter can be
very different.
 (A42/B59–60)&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant introduces transcendental idealism in the part of the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt;
called the Transcendental Aesthetic, and scholars generally agree that
for Kant transcendental idealism encompasses at least the following
claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="jfy"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In some sense, human beings experience only appearances, not things
in themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Space and time are not things in themselves, or determinations of
things in themselves that would remain if one abstracted from all
subjective conditions of human intuition. [Kant labels this conclusion
a) at A26/B42 and again at A32–33/B49. It is at least a crucial part of
what he means by calling space and time transcendentally ideal
(A28/B44, A35–36/B52)].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Space and time are nothing other than the subjective forms of human
sensible intuition. [Kant labels this conclusion b) at A26/B42 and
again at A33/B49–50].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Space and time are empirically real, which means that “everything
that can come before us externally as an object” is in both space and
time, and that our internal intuitions of ourselves are in time
(A28/B44, A34–35/B51–51).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

But scholars disagree widely on how to interpret these claims, and
there is no such thing as the standard interpretation of Kant’s
transcendental idealism. Two general types of interpretation have been
especially influential, however. This section provides an overview of
these two interpretations, although it should be emphasized that much
important scholarship on transcendental idealism does not fall neatly
into either of these two camps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="TwoObjInt"&gt;3.1 The two-objects interpretation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The two-objects reading is the traditional interpretation of Kant’s
transcendental idealism. It goes back to the earliest review of the
&lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; – the so-called Göttingen review by Christian Garve
(1742–1798) and J. G. Feder
 (1740–1821)&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; –
 and it was the
dominant way of interpreting Kant’s transcendental idealism during his
own lifetime. It has been a live interpretive option since then and
remains so today, although it no longer enjoys the dominance that it
once
 did.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
According to the two-objects interpretation, transcendental idealism is
essentially a metaphysical thesis that distinguishes between two
classes of objects: appearances and things in themselves. Another name
for this view is the two-worlds interpretation, since it can also be
expressed by saying that transcendental idealism essentially
distinguishes between a world of appearances and another world of
things in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Things in themselves, on this interpretation, are absolutely real in
the sense that they would exist and have whatever properties they have
even if no human beings were around to perceive them. Appearances, on
the other hand, are not absolutely real in that sense, because their
existence and properties depend on human perceivers. Moreover, whenever
appearances do exist, in some sense they exist in the mind of human
perceivers. So appearances are mental entities or mental
representations. This, coupled with the claim that we experience only
appearances, makes transcendental idealism a form of phenomenalism on
this interpretation, because it reduces the objects of experience to
mental representations. All of our experiences – all of our
perceptions of objects and events in space, even those objects and
events themselves, and all non-spatial but still temporal thoughts and
feelings – fall into the class of appearances that exist in the
mind of human perceivers. These appearances cut us off entirely from
the reality of things in themselves, which are non-spatial and
non-temporal. Yet Kant’s theory, on this interpretation, nevertheless
requires that things in themselves exist, because they must transmit to
us the sensory data from which we construct appearances. In principle
we cannot know how things in themselves affect our senses, because our
experience and knowledge is limited to the world of appearances
constructed by and in the mind. Things in themselves are therefore a
sort of theoretical posit, whose existence and role are required by the
theory but are not directly verifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The main problems with the two-objects interpretation are
philosophical. Most readers of Kant who have interpreted his
transcendental idealism in this way have been – often very
– critical of it, for reasons such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, at best Kant is walking a fine line in claiming on the one hand
that we can have no knowledge about things in themselves, but on the
other hand that we know that things in themselves exist, that they
affect our senses, and that they are non-spatial and non-temporal. At
worst his theory depends on contradictory claims about what we can and
cannot know about things in themselves. This objection was
influentially articulated by Jacobi, when he complained that
“without that presupposition [of things in themselves] I could
not enter into the system, but with it I could not stay within
it” (Jacobi 1787, 336).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Second, even if that problem is surmounted, it has seemed to many that
Kant’s theory, interpreted in this way, implies a radical form of
skepticism that traps each of us within the contents of our own mind
and cuts us off from reality. Some versions of this objection proceed
from premises that Kant rejects. One version maintains that things in
themselves are real while appearances are not, and hence that on Kant’s
view we cannot have experience or knowledge of reality. But Kant denies
that appearances are unreal: they are just as real as things in
themselves but are in a different metaphysical class. Another version
claims that truth always involves a correspondence between mental
representations and things in themselves, from which it would follow
that on Kant’s view it is impossible for us to have true beliefs about
the world. But just as Kant denies that things in themselves are the
only (or privileged) reality, he also denies that correspondence with
things in themselves is the only kind of truth. Empirical judgments are
true just in case they correspond with their empirical objects in
accordance with the a priori principles that structure all possible
human experience. But the fact that Kant can appeal in this way to an
objective criterion of empirical truth that is internal to our
experience has not been enough to convince some critics that Kant is
innocent of an unacceptable form of skepticism, mainly because of his
insistence on our irreparable ignorance about things in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Third and finally, Kant’s denial that things in themselves are spatial
or temporal has struck many of his readers as incoherent. The role of
things in themselves, on the two-object interpretation, is to affect
our senses and thereby to provide the sensory data from which our
cognitive faculties construct appearances within the framework of our a
priori intuitions of space and time and a priori concepts such as
causality. But if there is no space, time, change, or causation in the
realm of things in themselves, then how can things in themselves affect
us? Transcendental affection seems to involve a causal relation between
things in themselves and our sensibility. If this is simply the way we
unavoidably think about transcendental affection, because we can give
positive content to this thought only by employing the concept of a
cause, while it is nevertheless strictly false that things in
themselves affect us causally, then it seems not only that we are
ignorant of how things in themselves really affect us. It seems,
rather, to be incoherent that things in themselves could affect us at
all if they are not in space or time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="TwoAspInt"&gt;3.2 The two-aspects interpretation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The two-aspects reading attempts to interpret Kant’s transcendental
idealism in a way that enables it to be defended against at least some
of these objections. On this view, transcendental idealism does not
distinguish between two classes of objects but rather between two
different aspects of one and the same class of objects. For this reason
it is also called the one-world interpretation, since it holds that
there is only one world in Kant’s ontology, and that at least some
objects in that world have two different aspects: one aspect that
appears to us, and another aspect that does not appear to us. That is,
appearances are aspects of the same objects that also exist in
themselves. So, on this reading, appearances are not mental
representations, and transcendental idealism is not a form of
 phenomenalism.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are at least two main versions of the two-aspects theory. One
version treats transcendental idealism as a metaphysical theory
according to which objects have two aspects in the sense that they have
two sets of properties: one set of relational properties that appear to
us and are spatial and temporal, and another set of intrinsic
properties that do not appear to us and are not spatial or temporal
(Langton 1998). This property-dualist interpretation faces
epistemological objections similar to those faced by the two-objects
interpretation, because we are in no better position to acquire
knowledge about properties that do not appear to us than we are to
acquire knowledge about objects that do not appear to us. Moreover,
this interpretation also seems to imply that things in themselves are
spatial and temporal, since appearances have spatial and temporal
properties, and on this view appearances are the same objects as things
in themselves. But Kant explicitly denies that space and time are
properties of things in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A second version of the two-aspects theory departs more radically from
the traditional two-objects interpretation by denying that
transcendental idealism is at bottom a metaphysical theory. Instead, it
interprets transcendental idealism as a fundamentally epistemological
theory that distinguishes between two standpoints on the objects of
experience: the human standpoint, from which objects are viewed
relative to epistemic conditions that are peculiar to human cognitive
faculties (namely, the a priori forms of our sensible intuition); and
the standpoint of an intuitive intellect, from which the same objects
could be known in themselves and independently of any epistemic
conditions (Allison 2004). Human beings cannot really take up the
latter standpoint but can form only an empty concept of things as they
exist in themselves by abstracting from all the content of our
experience and leaving only the purely formal thought of an object in
general. So transcendental idealism, on this interpretation, is
essentially the thesis that we are limited to the human standpoint, and
the concept of a thing in itself plays the role of enabling us to chart
the boundaries of the human standpoint by stepping beyond them in
abstract (but empty) thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One criticism of this epistemological version of the two-aspects theory
is that it avoids the objections to other interpretations by
attributing to Kant a more limited project than the text of the
&lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; warrants. There are passages that support this
 reading.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; 
 But there are
also many passages in both editions of the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; in which Kant
describes appearances as representations in the mind and in which his
distinction between appearances and things in themselves is given not
only epistemological but metaphysical
 significance.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;
 It is unclear
whether all of these texts admit of a single, consistent
interpretation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="TraDed"&gt;4. The transcendental deduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The transcendental deduction is the central argument of the &lt;em&gt;Critique
of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt; and one of the most complex and difficult texts in the
history of philosophy. Given its complexity, there are naturally many
different ways of interpreting the
 deduction.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; This
 brief
overview provides one perspective on some of its main ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The transcendental deduction occurs in the part of the &lt;em&gt;Critique&lt;/em&gt; called
the Analytic of Concepts, which deals with the a priori concepts that,
on Kant’s view, our understanding uses to construct experience together
with the a priori forms of our sensible intuition (space and time),
which he discussed in the Transcendental Aesthetic. Kant calls these a
priori concepts “categories,” and he argues elsewhere (in the so-called
metaphysical deduction) that they include such concepts as substance
and cause. The goal of the transcendental deduction is to show that we
have a priori concepts or categories that are objectively valid, or
that apply necessarily to all objects in the world that we experience.
To show this, Kant argues that the categories are necessary conditions
of experience, or that we could not have experience without the
categories. In Kant’s words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he objective validity of the categories, as a priori concepts,
rests on the fact that through them alone is experience possible (as
far as the form of thinking is concerned). For they then are related
necessarily and a priori to objects of experience, since only by means
of them can any object of experience be thought at all.

&lt;p&gt;
 The transcendental deduction of all a priori concepts therefore has a
principle toward which the entire investigation must be directed,
namely this: that they must be recognized as a priori conditions of
the possibility of experiences (whether of the intuition that is
encountered in them, or of the thinking). Concepts that supply the
objective ground of the possibility of experience are necessary just
for that reason. (A93–94/B126)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The strategy Kant employs to argue that the categories are conditions
of experience is the main source of both the obscurity and the
ingenuity of the transcendental deduction. His strategy is to argue
that the categories are necessary specifically for self-consciousness,
for which Kant often uses the Leibnizian term “apperception.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="SelCon"&gt;4.1 Self-consciousness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

One way to approach Kant’s argument is to contrast his view of
self-consciousness with two alternative views that he rejects. Each of
these views, both Kant’s and those he rejects, can be seen as offering
competing answers the question: what is the source of our sense of an
ongoing and invariable self that persists throughout all the changes in
our experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first answer to this question that Kant rejects is that
self-consciousness arises from some particular content being present in
each of one’s representations. This material conception of
self-consciousness, as we may call it, is suggested by
Locke’s account of personal identity. According to Locke, “it
being the same consciousness that makes a Man be himself to himself,
personal Identity depends on that only, whether it be annexed only to
one individual Substance, or can be continued in a succession of
several Substances” (&lt;em&gt;Essay&lt;/em&gt; 2.27.10). What Locke calls “the same
consciousness” may be understood as some representational content that
is always present in my experience and that both identifies any
experience as mine and gives me a sense of a continuous self by virtue
of its continual presence in my experience. One problem with this view,
Kant believes, is that there is no such representational content that
is invariably present in experience, so the sense of an ongoing self
cannot possibly arise from that non-existent content (what Locke calls
“consciousness”) being present in each of one’s representations. In
Kant’s words, self-consciousness “does not yet come about by my
accompanying each representation with consciousness, but rather by my
adding one representation to the other and being conscious of their
synthesis. Therefore it is only because I can combine a manifold of
given representations in one consciousness that it is possible for me
to represent the identity of the consciousness in these
representations” (B133). Here Kant claims, against the Lockean
view, that self-consciousness arises from combining (or synthesizing)
representations with one another regardless of their content. In short,
Kant has a formal conception of self-consciousness rather than a
material one. Since no particular content of my experience is
invariable, self-consciousness must derive from my experience having an
invariable form or structure, and consciousness of the identity of
myself through all of my changing experiences must consist in awareness
of the formal unity and law-governed regularity of my experience. The
continuous form of my experience is the necessary correlate for my
sense of a continuous self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are at least two possible versions of the formal conception of
self-consciousness: a realist and an idealist version. On the realist
version, nature itself is law-governed and we become self-conscious by
attending to its law-governed regularities, which also makes this an
empiricist view of self-consciousness. The idea of an identical self
that persists throughout all of our experience, on this view, arises
from the law-governed regularity of nature, and our representations
exhibit order and regularity because reality itself is ordered and
regular. Kant rejects this realist view and embraces a conception of
self-consciousness that is both formal and idealist. According to Kant,
the formal structure of our experience, its unity and law-governed
regularity, is an achievement of our cognitive faculties rather than a
property of reality in itself. Our experience has a constant form
because our mind constructs experience in a law-governed way. So
self-consciousness, for Kant, consists in awareness of the mind’s
law-governed activity of synthesizing or combining sensible data to
construct a unified experience. As he expresses it, “this unity of
consciousness would be impossible if in the cognition of the manifold
the mind could not become conscious of the identity of the function by
means of which this manifold is synthetically combined into one
cognition” (A108).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant argues for this formal idealist conception of self-consciousness,
and against the formal realist view, on the grounds that “we can
represent nothing as combined in the object without having previously
combined it ourselves” (B130). In other words, even if reality in
itself were law-governed, its laws could not simply migrate over to our
mind or imprint themselves on us while our mind is entirely passive. We
must exercise an active capacity to represent the world as combined or
ordered in a law-governed way, because otherwise we could not represent
the world as law-governed even if it were law-governed in itself.
Moreover, this capacity to represent the world as law-governed must be
a priori because it is a condition of self-consciousness, and we would
already have to be self-conscious in order to learn from our experience
that there are law-governed regularities in the world. So it is
necessary for self-consciousness that we exercise an a priori capacity
to represent the world as law-governed. But this would also be
sufficient for self-consciousness if we could exercise our a priori
capacity to represent the world as law-governed even if reality in
itself were not law-governed. In that case, the realist and empiricist
conception of self-consciousness would be false, and the formal
idealist view would be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant’s confidence that no empiricist account could possibly explain
self-consciousness may be based on his assumption that the sense of
self each of us has, the thought of oneself as identical throughout all
of one’s changing experiences, involves necessity and universality,
which on his view are the hallmarks of the a priori. This assumption is
reflected in what we may call Kant’s principle of apperception: “The &lt;b&gt;I
think&lt;/b&gt; must &lt;b&gt;be able&lt;/b&gt; to accompany all my representations; for otherwise
something would be represented in me that could not be thought at all,
which is as much as to say that the representation would either be
impossible or else at least would be nothing for me”
 (B131–132).&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; 
 Notice the
claims about necessity and universality embodied in the words “must”
and “all” here. Kant is saying that for a representation to count as
mine, it must necessarily be accessible to conscious awareness in some
(perhaps indirect) way: I must be able to accompany it with “I
think….” All of my representations must be accessible to
consciousness in this way (but they need not actually be conscious),
because again that is simply what makes a representation count as mine.
Self-consciousness for Kant therefore involves a priori knowledge about
the necessary and universal truth expressed in this principle of
apperception, and a priori knowledge cannot be based on experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant may have developed this thread of his
argument in the transcendental deduction after reading Johann Nicolaus
Tetens (1736–1807) rather than through a direct encounter with
Locke’s texts (Tetens 1777, Kitcher 2011). On the subject of
self-consciousness, Tetens was a follower of Locke and also engaged
with Hume’s arguments for rejecting a continuing self. So Kant’s
actual opponents in the deduction may have been Lockean and Humean
positions as represented by Tetens, as well as rationalist views that
Kant would have encountered directly in texts by Leibniz, Wolff, and
some of their followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="ObjJud"&gt;4.2 Objectivity and judgment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

On the basis of this formal idealist conception of
self-consciousness, Kant’s argument (at least one central thread of it)
moves through two more conditions of self-consciousness in order to
establish the objective validity of the categories. The next condition
is that self-consciousness requires me to represent an objective world
distinct from my subjective representations – that is, distinct from my
thoughts about and sensations of that objective world. Kant uses this
connection between self-consciousness and objectivity to insert the
categories into his argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In order to be self-conscious, I cannot be wholly absorbed in the
contents of my perceptions but must distinguish myself from the rest of
the world. But if self-consciousness is an achievement of the mind,
then how does the mind achieve this sense that there is a distinction
between the I that perceives and the contents of its perceptions?
According to Kant, the mind achieves this sense by distinguishing
representations that necessarily belong together from representations
that are not necessarily connected but are merely associated in a
contingent way. Consider Kant’s example of the perception of a house
(B162). Imagine a house that is too large to fit into your visual field
from your vantage point near its front door. Now imagine that you walk
around the house, successively perceiving each of its sides. Eventually
you perceive the entire house, but not all at once, and you judge that
each of your representations of the sides of the house necessarily
belong together (as sides of one house) and that anyone who denied this
would be mistaken. But now imagine that you grew up in this house and
associate a feeling of nostalgia with it. You would not judge that
representations of this house are necessarily connected with feelings
of nostalgia. That is, you would not think that other people seeing the
house for the first time would be mistaken if they denied that it is
connected with nostalgia, because you recognize that this house is
connected with nostalgia for you but not necessarily for everyone. Yet
you distinguish this merely subjective connection from the objective
connection between sides of the house, which is objective because the
sides of the house necessarily belong together “in the object,” because
this connection holds for everyone universally, and because it is
possible to be mistaken about it. The point here is not that we must
successfully identify which representations necessarily belong together
and which are merely associated contingently, but rather that to be
self-conscious we must at least make this general distinction between
objective and merely subjective connections of representations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At this point (at least in the second edition text) Kant introduces the
key claim that judgment is what enables us to distinguish objective
connections of representations that necessarily belong together from
merely subjective and contingent associations: “[A] judgment is nothing
other than the way to bring given cognitions to the objective unity of
apperception. That is the aim of the copula &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; in them: to distinguish
the objective unity of given representations from the subjective. For
this word designates the relation of the representations to the
original apperception and its necessary unity” (B141–142). Kant is
speaking here about the mental act of judging that results in the
formation of a judgment. Judging is an act of what Kant calls
synthesis, which he defines as “the action of putting different
representations together with each other and comprehending their
manifoldness in one cognition” (A77/B103). In other words, to
synthesize is in general to combine several representations into a
single (more) complex representation, and to judge is specifically to
combine concepts into a judgment – that is, to join a subject concept
to a predicate concept by means of the copula, as in “the body is
heavy” or “the house is four-sided.” Judgments need not be true, of
course, but they always have a truth value (true or false) because they
make claims to objective validity. When I say, by contrast, that “If I
carry a body, I feel a pressure of weight,” or that “if I see this
house, I feel nostalgia,” I am not making a judgment about the object
(the body or the house) but rather I am expressing a subjective
association that may apply only to me
 (B142).&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant’s reference to the necessary unity of apperception or
self-consciousness in the quotation above means (at least) that the
action of judging is the way our mind achieves self-consciousness. We
must represent an objective world in order to distinguish ourselves
from it, and we represent an objective world by judging that some
representations necessarily belong together. Moreover, recall from
 &lt;a href="#SelCon"&gt;4.1&lt;/a&gt;
 that, for Kant, we must have an a priori capacity
to represent the world as law-governed, because “we can represent
nothing as combined (or connected) in the object without having
previously combined it ourselves” (B130). It follows that objective
connections in the world cannot simply imprint themselves on our mind.
Rather, experience of an objective world must be constructed by
exercising an a priori capacity to judge, which Kant calls the faculty
of understanding (A80–81/B106). The understanding constructs experience
by providing the a priori rules, or the framework of necessary laws, in
accordance with which we judge representations to be objective. These
rules are the pure concepts of the understanding or categories, which
are therefore conditions of self-consciousness, since they are rules
for judging about an objective world, and self-consciousness requires
that we distinguish ourselves from an objective world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant identifies the categories in what he calls the metaphysical
deduction, which precedes the transcendental
 deduction.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; Very
briefly, since the categories are a priori rules for judging, Kant
argues that an exhaustive table of categories can be derived from a
table of the basic logical forms of judgments. For example, according
to Kant the logical form of the judgment that “the body is heavy” would
be singular, affirmative, categorical, and assertoric. But since
categories are not mere logical functions but instead are rules for
making judgments about objects or an objective world, Kant arrives at
his table of categories by considering how each logical function would
structure judgments about objects (within our spatio-temporal forms of
intuition). For example, he claims that categorical judgments express a
logical relation between subject and predicate that corresponds to the
ontological relation between substance and accident; and the logical
form of a hypothetical judgment expresses a relation that corresponds
to cause and effect. Taken together with this argument, then, the
transcendental deduction argues that we become self-conscious by
representing an objective world of substances that interact according
to causal laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="LawGivNat"&gt;4.3 The law-giver of nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final condition of self-consciousness that Kant adds to the
preceding conditions is that our understanding must cooperate with
sensibility to construct one, unbounded, and unified space-time to
which all of our representations may be related. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To see why this further condition is required, consider that so far we
have seen why Kant holds that we must represent an objective world in
order to be self-conscious, but we could represent an objective world
even if it were not possible to relate all of our representations to
this objective world. For all that has been said so far, we might
still have unruly representations that we cannot relate in any way to
the objective framework of our experience. On Kant’s view, this would
be a problem because, as we have seen, he holds that
self-consciousness involves universality and necessity: according to
his principle of apperception, “the &lt;b&gt;I think&lt;/b&gt; must &lt;b&gt;be able&lt;/b&gt; to
accompany all my representations” (B131). Yet if, on the one
hand, I had representations that I could not relate in some way to an
objective world, then I could not accompany those representations with
“I think” or recognize them as my representations, because
I can say “I think…” about any given representation only
by relating it to an objective world, according to the argument just
discussed. So I must be able to relate any given representation to an
objective world in order for it to count as mine.  On the other hand,
self-consciousness would also be impossible if I represented multiple
objective worlds, even if I could relate all of my representations to
some objective world or other. In that case, I could not become
conscious of an identical self that has, say, representation 1 in
space-time A and representation 2 in space-time B. It may be possible
to imagine disjointed spaces and times, but it is not possible to
represent them as objectively real. So self-consciousness requires
that I can relate all of my representations to a single objective
world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The reason why I must represent this one objective world by means of a
unified and unbounded space-time is that, as Kant argued in the
Transcendental Aesthetic, space and time are the pure forms of human
intuition. If we had different forms of intuition, then our experience
would still have to constitute a unified whole in order for us to be
self-conscious, but this would not be a spatio-temporal whole. Given
that space and time are our forms of intuition, however, our
understanding must still cooperate with sensibility to construct a
spatio-temporal whole of experience because, once again, “we can
represent nothing as combined in the object without having previously
combined it ourselves,” and “all combination […] is an action of the
understanding” (B130). So Kant distinguishes between space and time as
pure forms of intuition, which belong solely to sensibility; and the
formal intuitions of space and time (or space-time), which are unified
by the understanding (B160–161). These formal intuitions are the
spatio-temporal whole within which our understanding constructs
experience in accordance with the
 categories.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The most important implication of Kant’s claim that the understanding
constructs a single whole of experience to which all of our
representations can be related is that, since he defines nature
“regarded materially” as “the sum total of all
appearances” and he has argued that the categories are
objectively valid of all possible appearances, on his view it follows
that our categories are the source of the fundamental laws of nature
“regarded formally” (B163, 165). So Kant concludes on this
basis that the understanding is the true law-giver of nature. In his
words: “all appearances in nature, as far as their combination
is concerned, stand under the categories, on which nature (considered
merely as nature in general) depends, as the original ground of its
necessary lawfulness (as nature regarded formally)” (B165). Or
more strongly: “we ourselves bring into the appearances that
order and regularity that we call &lt;b&gt;nature&lt;/b&gt;, and moreover we would not be
able to find it there if we, or the nature of our mind, had not
originally put it there. […] The understanding is thus not merely a
faculty for making rules through the comparison of the appearances: it
is itself the legislation for nature, i.e., without understanding
there would not be any nature at all” (A125–126). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="MorFre"&gt;5. Morality and freedom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Having examined two central parts of Kant’s positive project in
theoretical philosophy from the &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt;, transcendental
idealism and the transcendental deduction, let us now turn to his
practical philosophy in the &lt;em&gt;Critique of Practical
 Reason&lt;/em&gt;.
 Since Kant’s
philosophy is deeply systematic, this section begins with a preliminary
look at how his theoretical and practical philosophy fit together (see
also section
 &lt;a href="#UniNatFre"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="ThePraAut"&gt;5.1 Theoretical and practical autonomy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The fundamental idea of Kant’s philosophy is human autonomy. So far
we have seen this in Kant’s constructivist view of experience,
according to which our understanding is the source of the general laws
of nature. “Autonomy” literally means giving the law to oneself, and on
Kant’s view our understanding provides laws that constitute the a
priori framework of our experience. Our understanding does not provide
the matter or content of our experience, but it does provide the basic
formal structure within which we experience any matter received through
our senses. Kant’s central argument for this view is the transcendental
deduction, according to which it is a condition of self-consciousness
that our understanding constructs experience in this way. So we may
call self-consciousness the highest principle of Kant’s theoretical
philosophy, since it is (at least) the basis for all of our a priori
knowledge about the structure of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant’s moral philosophy is also based on the idea of autonomy. He holds
that there is a single fundamental principle of morality, on which all
specific moral duties are based. He calls this moral law (as it is
manifested to us) the categorical imperative (see
 &lt;a href="#CatImp"&gt;5.4&lt;/a&gt;).
 The moral law is a product of reason, for Kant, while
the basic laws of nature are products of our understanding. There are
important differences between the senses in which we are autonomous in
constructing our experience and in morality. For example, Kant regards
understanding and reason as different cognitive faculties, although he
sometimes uses “reason” in a wide sense to cover
 both.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; 
 The categories
and therefore the laws of nature are dependent on our specifically
human forms of intuition, while reason is not. The moral law does not
depend on any qualities that are peculiar to human nature but only on
the nature of reason as such, although its manifestation to us as a
categorical imperative (as a law of duty) reflects the fact that the
human will is not necessarily determined by pure reason but is also
influenced by other incentives rooted in our needs and inclinations;
and our specific duties deriving from the categorical imperative do
reflect human nature and the contingencies of human life. Despite these
differences, however, Kant holds that we give the moral law to
ourselves, as we also give the general laws of nature to
ourselves, though in a different sense. Moreover, we each necessarily give the same
moral law to ourselves, just as we each construct our experience in
accordance with the same categories. To summarize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="jfy"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theoretical philosophy is about how the world is (A633/B661). Its
highest principle is self-consciousness, on which our knowledge of the
basic laws of nature is based. Given sensory data, our understanding
constructs experience according to these a priori laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practical philosophy is about how the world ought to be (ibid.,
A800–801/B828–829). Its highest principle is the moral law, from which
we derive duties that command how we ought to act in specific
situations. Kant also claims that reflection on our moral duties and
our need for happiness leads to the thought of an ideal world, which he
calls the highest good (see section
 &lt;a href="#HigGoo"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;).
 Given how the world is (theoretical philosophy) and how it ought to be (practical
philosophy), we aim to make the world better by constructing or
realizing the highest good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

So both parts of Kant’s philosophy are about autonomously
constructing a world, but in different senses. In theoretical
philosophy, we use our categories and forms of intuition to construct a
world of experience or nature. In practical philosophy, we use the
moral law to construct the idea of a moral world or a realm of ends
that guides our conduct (4:433), and ultimately to transform the
natural world into the highest good. Finally, transcendental idealism
is the framework within which these two parts of Kant’s philosophy fit
together (20:311). Theoretical philosophy deals with appearances, to
which our knowledge is strictly limited; and practical philosophy deals
with things in themselves, although it does not give us knowledge about
things in themselves but only provides rational justification for
certain beliefs about them for practical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand Kant’s arguments that practical philosophy justifies
certain beliefs about things in themselves, it is necessary to see
them in the context of his criticism of German rationalist
metaphysics. The three traditional topics of Leibniz-Wolffian special
metaphysics were rational psychology, rational cosmology, and rational
theology, which dealt, respectively, with the human soul, the
world-whole, and God. In the part of the Critique of Pure Reason
called the Transcendental Dialectic, Kant argues against the
Leibniz-Wolffian view that human beings are capable of a priori
knowledge in each of these domains, and he claims that the errors of
Leibniz-Wolffian metaphysics are due to an illusion that has its seat
in the nature of human reason itself. According to Kant, human reason
necessarily produces ideas of the soul, the world-whole, and God; and
these ideas unavoidably produce the illusion that we have a priori
knowledge about transcendent objects corresponding to them. This is an
illusion, however, because in fact we are not capable of a priori
knowledge about any such transcendent objects. Nevertheless, Kant
attempts to show that these illusory ideas have a positive, practical
use. He thus reframes Leibniz-Wolffian special metaphysics as a
practical science that he calls the metaphysics of morals. On Kant’s
view, our ideas of the soul, the world-whole, and God provide the
content of morally justified beliefs about human immortality, human
freedom, and the existence of God, respectively; but they are not
proper objects of speculative
 knowledge.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="Fre"&gt;5.2 Freedom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The most important belief about things in themselves that Kant
thinks only practical philosophy can justify concerns human freedom.
Freedom is important because, on Kant’s view, moral appraisal
presupposes that we are free in the sense that we have the ability to
do otherwise. To see why, consider Kant’s example of a man who commits
a theft (5:95ff.). Kant holds that in order for this man’s action to be
morally wrong, it must have been within his control in the sense that
it was within his power at the time not to have committed the theft. If
this was not within his control at the time, then, while it may be
useful to punish him in order to shape his behavior or to influence
others, it nevertheless would not be correct to say that his action was
morally wrong. Moral rightness and wrongness apply only to free agents
who control their actions and have it in their power, at the time of
their actions, either to act rightly or not. According to Kant, this is
just common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On these grounds, Kant rejects a type of compatibilism that he calls
the “comparative concept of freedom” and associates with
Leibniz (5:96–97). (Note that Kant has a specific type of
compatibilism in mind, which I will refer to simply as
“compatibilism,” although there may be other types of
compatibilism that do not fit Kant’s characterization of that
view). On the compatibilist view, as Kant understands it, I am free
whenever the cause of my action is within me. So I am unfree only when
something external to me pushes or moves me, but I am free whenever
the proximate cause of my body’s movement is internal to me as an
“acting being” (5:96). If we distinguish between
involuntary convulsions and voluntary bodily movements, then on this
view free actions are just voluntary bodily movements. Kant ridicules
this view as a “wretched subterfuge” that tries to solve
an ancient philosophical problem “with a little quibbling about
words” (ibid.). This view, he says, assimilates human freedom to
“the freedom of a turnspit,” or a projectile in flight, or
the motion of a clock’s hands (5:96–97). The proximate causes of
these movements are internal to the turnspit, the projectile, and the
clock at the time of the movement. This cannot be sufficient for moral
responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why not? The reason, Kant says, is ultimately that the causes of these
movements occur in time. Return to the theft example. A compatibilist
would say that the thief’s action is free because its proximate cause
is inside him, and because the theft was not an involuntary convulsion
but a voluntary action. The thief decided to commit the theft, and his
action flowed from this decision. According to Kant, however, if the
thief’s decision is a natural phenomenon that occurs in time, then it
must be the effect of some cause that occurred in a previous time. This
is an essential part of Kant’s Newtonian worldview and is grounded in
the a priori laws (specifically, the category of cause and effect) in
accordance with which our understanding constructs experience: every
event has a cause that begins in an earlier time. If that cause too was
an event occurring in time, then it must also have a cause beginning in
a still earlier time, etc. All natural events occur in time and are
thoroughly determined by causal chains that stretch backwards into the
distant past. So there is no room for freedom in nature, which is
deterministic in a strong sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The root of the problem, for Kant, is time. Again, if the thief’s
choice to commit the theft is a natural event in time, then it is the
effect of a causal chain extending into the distant past. But the past
is out of his control now, in the present. Once the past is past, he
can’t change it. On Kant’s view, that is why his actions would not be
in his control in the present if they are determined by events in the
past. Even if he could control those past events in the past, he cannot
control them now. But in fact past events were not in his control in
the past either if they too were determined by events in the more
distant past, because eventually the causal antecedents of his action
stretch back before his birth, and obviously events that occurred
before his birth were never in his control. So if the thief’s choice to
commit the theft is a natural event in time, then it is not now and
never was in his control, and he could not have done otherwise than to
commit the theft. In that case, it would be a mistake to hold him
morally responsible for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Compatibilism, as Kant understands it, therefore locates the issue in
the wrong place. Even if the cause of my action is internal to me, if
it is in the past – for example, if my action today is
determined by a decision I made yesterday, or from the character I
developed in childhood – then it is not within my control
now. The real issue is not whether the cause of my action is internal
or external to me, but whether it is in my control now. For Kant,
however, the cause of my action can be within my control now only if
it is not in time. This is why Kant thinks that transcendental
idealism is the only way to make sense of the kind of freedom that
morality requires. Transcendental idealism allows that the cause
of my action may be a thing in itself outside of time: namely, my
noumenal self, which is free because it is not part of nature. No
matter what kind of character I have developed or what external
influences act on me, on Kant’s view all of my intentional, voluntary
actions are immediate effects of my noumenal self, which is causally
undetermined (5:97–98). My noumenal self is an uncaused cause
outside of time, which therefore is not subject to the deterministic
laws of nature in accordance with which our understanding constructs
experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many puzzles arise on this picture that Kant does not resolve. For
example, if my understanding constructs all appearances in my
experience of nature, not only appearances of my own actions, then why
am I responsible only for my own actions but not for everything that
happens in the natural world? Moreover, if I am not alone in the world
but there are many noumenal selves acting freely and incorporating
their free actions into the experience they construct, then how do
multiple transcendentally free agents interact? How do you integrate my
free actions into the experience that your understanding
 constructs?&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;
 In spite of these
unsolved puzzles, Kant holds that we can make sense of moral appraisal
and responsibility only by thinking about human freedom in this way,
because it is the only way to prevent natural necessity from
undermining both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, since Kant invokes transcendental idealism to make sense
of freedom, interpreting his thinking about freedom leads us back to
disputes between the two-objects and two-aspects interpretations of
transcendental idealism. On the face of it, the two-objects
interpretation seems to make better sense of Kant’s view of
transcendental freedom than the two-aspects interpretation. If
morality requires that I am transcendentally free, then it seems that
my true self, and not just an aspect of my self, must be outside of
time, according to Kant’s argument. But applying the two-objects
interpretation to freedom raises problems of its own, since it
involves making a distinction between noumenal and phenomenal selves
that does not arise on the two-aspects view. If only my noumenal self
is free, and freedom is required for moral responsibility, then my
phenomenal self is not morally responsible. But how are my noumenal
and phenomenal selves related, and why is punishment inflicted on
phenomenal selves? It is unclear whether and to what extent appealing
to Kant’s theory of freedom can help to settle disputes about the
proper interpretation of transcendental idealism, since there are
serious questions about the coherence of Kant’s theory on either
interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="FacRea"&gt;5.3 The fact of reason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we know that we are free in this transcendental sense? Kant’s
response is tricky. On the one hand, he distinguishes between
theoretical knowledge and morally justified belief
(A820–831/B848–859).  We do not have theoretical knowledge
that we are free or about anything beyond the limits of possible
experience, but we are morally justified in believing that we are free
in this sense. On the other hand, Kant also uses stronger language
than this when discussing freedom. For example, he says that
“among all the ideas of speculative reason freedom is the only
one the possibility of which we know a priori, though without having
any insight into it, because it is the condition of the moral law,
which we do know.” In a footnote to this passage, Kant explains
that we know freedom a priori because “were there no freedom,
the moral law would not be encountered at all in ourselves,” and
on Kant’s view everyone does encounter the moral law a priori
(5:4). For this reason, Kant claims that the moral law
“proves” the objective, “though only practical,
undoubted reality” of freedom (5:48–49). So Kant wants to
say that we do have knowledge of the reality of freedom, but that this
is practical knowledge of a practical reality, or cognition
“only for practical purposes,” by which he means to
distinguish it from theoretical knowledge based on experience or
reflection on the conditions of experience (5:133). Our practical
knowledge of freedom is based instead on the moral law. The difference
between Kant’s stronger and weaker language seems mainly to be that
his stronger language emphasizes that our belief or practical
knowledge about freedom is unshakeable and that it in turn provides
support for other morally grounded beliefs in God and the immortality
of the soul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant calls our consciousness of the moral law, our awareness that the
moral law binds us or has authority over us, the “fact of
reason” (5:31–32, 42–43, 47, 55). So, on his view,
the fact of reason is the practical basis for our belief or practical
knowledge that we are free.  Kant insists that this moral
consciousness is “undeniable,” “a priori,” and
“unavoidable” (5:32, 47, 55). Every human being has a
conscience, a common sense grasp of morality, and a firm conviction
that he or she is morally accountable. We may have different beliefs
about the source of morality’s authority – God, social
convention, human reason. We may arrive at different conclusions about
what morality requires in specific situations. And we may violate our
own sense of duty. But we all have a conscience, and an unshakeable
belief that morality applies to us. According to Kant, this belief
cannot and does not need to be justified or “proved by any
deduction” (5:47). It is just a ground-level fact about human
beings that we hold ourselves morally accountable. But Kant is making
a normative claim here as well: it is also a fact, which cannot and
does not need to be justified, that we are morally accountable, that
morality does have authority over us.  Kant holds that philosophy
should be in the business of defending this common sense moral belief,
and that in any case we could never prove or disprove it (4:459).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant may hold that the fact of reason, or our consciousness of moral
obligation, implies that we are free on the grounds that ought implies
can. In other words, Kant may believe that it follows from the fact
that we ought (morally) to do something that we can or are able to do
it. This is suggested, for example, by a passage in which Kant asks us
to imagine someone threatened by his prince with immediate execution
unless he “give[s] false testimony against an honorable man whom the
prince would like to destroy under a plausible pretext.” Kant says that
“[h]e would perhaps not venture to assert whether he would do it or
not, but he must admit without hesitation that it would be possible for
him. He judges, therefore, that he can do something because he is aware
that he ought to do it and cognizes freedom within him, which, without
the moral law, would have remained unknown to him” (5:30). This is a
hypothetical example of an action not yet carried out. It seems that
pangs of guilt about the immorality of an action that you carried out
in the past, on this reasoning, would imply more directly that you have
(or at least had) the ability to act otherwise than you did, and
therefore that you are free in Kant’s sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="CatImp"&gt;5.4 The categorical imperative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

In both the &lt;em&gt;Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Critique
of Practical Reason&lt;/em&gt;, Kant also gives a more detailed argument for the
conclusion that morality and freedom reciprocally imply one another,
which is sometimes called the reciprocity thesis (Allison 1990). On
this view, to act morally is to exercise freedom, and the only way to
fully exercise freedom is to act morally. Kant’s arguments for this
view differ in these texts, but the general structure of his argument
in the &lt;em&gt;Critique of Practical Reason&lt;/em&gt; may be summarized as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, it follows from the basic idea of having a will that to act at
all is to act on some principle, or what Kant calls a maxim. A maxim
is a subjective rule or policy of action: it says what you are doing
and why. Kant gives as examples the maxims “to let no
insult pass unavenged” and “to increase my wealth by every
safe means” (5:19, 27).  We may be unaware of our maxims, we may
not act consistently on the same maxims, and our maxims may not be
consistent with one another. But Kant holds that since we are rational
beings our actions always aim at some sort of end or goal, which our
maxim expresses. The goal of an action may be something as basic as
gratifying a desire, or it may be something more complex such as
becoming a doctor or a lawyer. In any case, the causes of our actions
are never our desires or impulses, on Kant’s view. If I act to gratify
some desire, then I choose to act on a maxim that specifies the
gratification of that desire as the goal of my action. For example, if
I desire some coffee, then I may act on the maxim to go to a cafe and
buy some coffee in order to gratify that desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Second, Kant distinguishes between two basic kinds of principles or
rules that we can act on: what he calls material and formal principles.
To act in order to satisfy some desire, as when I act on the maxim to
go for coffee at a cafe, is to act on a material principle (5:21ff.).
Here the desire (for coffee) fixes the goal, which Kant calls the
object or matter of the action, and the principle says how to achieve
that goal (go to a cafe). Corresponding to material principles, on
Kant’s view, are what he calls hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical
imperative is a principle of rationality that says I should act in
a certain way if I choose to satisfy some desire. If maxims in general
are rules that describe how one does act, then imperatives in general
prescribe how one should act. An imperative is hypothetical if it says
how I should act only if I choose to pursue some goal in order to
gratify a desire (5:20). This, for example, is a hypothetical
imperative: if you want coffee, then go to the cafe. This hypothetical
imperative applies to you only if you desire coffee and choose to
gratify that desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In contrast to material principles, formal principles describe how one
acts without making reference to any desires. This is easiest to
understand through the corresponding kind of imperative, which Kant
calls a categorical imperative. A categorical imperative commands
unconditionally that I should act in some way. So while hypothetical
imperatives apply to me only on the condition that I have and set the
goal of satisfying the desires that they tell me how to satisfy,
categorical imperatives apply to me no matter what my goals and desires
may be. Kant regards moral laws as categorical imperatives, which apply
to everyone unconditionally. For example, the moral requirement to help
others in need does not apply to me only if I desire to help others in
need, and the duty not to steal is not suspended if I have some desire
that I could satisfy by stealing. Moral laws do not have such
conditions but rather apply unconditionally. That is why they apply to
everyone in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Third, insofar as I act only on material principles or hypothetical
imperatives, I do not act freely, but rather I act only to satisfy some
desire(s) that I have, and what I desire is not ultimately within my
control. To some limited extent we are capable of rationally shaping
our desires, but insofar as we choose to act in order to satisfy
desires we are choosing to let nature govern us rather than governing
ourselves (5:118). We are always free in the sense that we always have
the capacity to govern ourselves rationally instead of letting our
desires set our ends for us. But we may (freely) fail to exercise that
capacity. Moreover, since Kant holds that desires never cause us to
act, but rather we always choose to act on a maxim even when that maxim
specifies the satisfaction of a desire as the goal of our action, it
also follows that we are always free in the sense that we freely choose
our maxims. Nevertheless, our actions are not free in the sense of
being autonomous if we choose to act only on material principles, because in
that case we do not give the law to ourselves, but instead we choose to
allow nature in us (our desires) to determine the law for our
actions.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, the only way to act freely in the full sense of exercising
autonomy is therefore to act on formal principles or categorical
imperatives, which is also to act morally. Kant does not mean that
acting autonomously requires that we take no account of our desires,
which would be impossible (5:25, 61). Rather, he holds that we
typically formulate maxims with a view to satisfying our desires, but
that “as soon as we draw up maxims of the will for
ourselves” we become immediately conscious of the moral law
(5:29). This immediate consciousness of the moral law takes the
following form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have, for example, made it my maxim to increase my wealth by every
safe means. Now I have a deposit in my hands, the owner of which has
died and left no record of it. This is, naturally, a case for my maxim.
Now I want only to know whether that maxim could also hold as a
universal practical law. I therefore apply the maxim to the present
case and ask whether it could indeed take the form of a law, and
consequently whether I could through my maxim at the same time give
such a law as this: that everyone may deny a deposit which no one can
prove has been made. I at once become aware that such a principle, as a
law, would annihilate itself since it would bring it about that there
would be no deposits at all. (5:27)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In other words, to assess the moral permissibility of my maxim, I ask
whether everyone could act on it, or whether it could be willed as a universal
law. The issue is not whether it would be good if everyone acted on my
maxim, or whether I would like it, but only whether it would be
possible for my maxim to be willed as a universal law. This gets at the form, not
the matter or content, of the maxim. A maxim has morally permissible
form, for Kant, only if it could be willed as a universal law. If my maxim fails
this test, as this one does, then it is morally impermissible for me to
act on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If my maxim passes the universal law test, then it is morally
permissible for me to act on it, but I fully exercise my autonomy only
if my fundamental reason for acting on this maxim is that it is
morally permissible or required that I do so. Imagine that I am moved
by a feeling of sympathy to formulate the maxim to help someone in
need. In this case, my original reason for formulating this maxim is
that a certain feeling moved me. Such feelings are not entirely within
my control and may not be present when someone actually needs my
help. But this maxim passes Kant’s test: it could be willed as a
universal law that everyone help others in need from motives of
sympathy. So it would not be wrong to act on this maxim when the
feeling of sympathy so moves me.  But helping others in need would not
fully exercise my autonomy unless my fundamental reason for doing so
is not that I have some feeling or desire, but rather that it would be
right or at least permissible to do so. Only when such a purely formal
principle supplies the fundamental motive for my action do I act
autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So the moral law is a law of autonomy in the sense that “freedom
and unconditional practical law reciprocally imply each another”
(5:29).  Even when my maxims are originally suggested by my feelings
and desires, if I act only on morally permissible (or required) maxims
because they are morally permissible (or required), then my actions
will be autonomous. And the reverse is true as well: for Kant this is
the only way to act
 autonomously.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="HigGooPraPos"&gt;6. The highest good and practical postulates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Kant holds that reason unavoidably produces not only consciousness
of the moral law but also the idea of a world in which there is both
complete virtue and complete happiness, which he calls the highest
good. Our duty to promote the highest good, on Kant’s view, is the sum
of all moral duties, and we can fulfill this duty only if we believe
that the highest good is a possible state of affairs. Furthermore, we
can believe that the highest good is possible only if we also believe
in the immortality of the soul and the existence of God, according to
Kant. On this basis, he claims that it is morally necessary to believe
in the immortality of the soul and the existence of God, which he calls
postulates of pure practical reason. This section briefly outlines
Kant’s view of the highest good and his argument for these practical
postulates in the &lt;em&gt;Critique of Practical Reason&lt;/em&gt; and other works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="HigGoo"&gt;6.1 The highest good&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

In the previous section we saw that, on Kant’s view, the moral law is
a purely formal principle that commands us to act only on maxims that
have what he calls lawgiving form, which maxims have only if they can
be willed as universal laws. Moreover, our fundamental reason for
choosing to act on such maxims should be that they have this lawgiving
form, rather than that acting on them would achieve some end or goal
that would satisfy a desire (5:27). For example, I should help others
in need not, at bottom, because doing so would make me feel good, even
if it would, but rather because it is right; and it is right (or
permissible) to help others in need because this maxim can be willed
as a universal law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although Kant holds that the morality of an action depends on the
form of its maxim rather than its end or goal, he nevertheless claims
both that every human action has an end and that we are unavoidably
concerned with the consequences of our actions (4:437; 5:34; 6:5–7,
385). This is not a moral requirement but simply part of what it means
to be a rational being. Moreover, Kant also holds the stronger view
that it is an unavoidable feature of human reason that we form ideas
not only about the immediate and near-term consequences of our actions,
but also about ultimate consequences. This is the practical
manifestation of reason’s general demand for what Kant calls “the
unconditioned”
 (5:107–108).&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;
 In particular, since
we naturally have desires and inclinations, and our reason has “a
commission” to attend to the satisfaction of our desires and
inclinations, on Kant’s view we unavoidably form an idea of the maximal
satisfaction of all our inclinations and desires, which he calls
happiness (5:61, 22, 124). This idea is indeterminate, however, since
nobody can know “what he really wishes and wills” and thus what would
make him completely happy (4:418). We also form the idea of a moral
world or realm of ends, in which everyone acts only in accordance with
maxims that can be universal laws (A808/B836, 4:433ff.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But neither of these ideas by itself expresses our unconditionally
complete end, as human reason demands in its practical use. A perfectly
moral world by itself would not constitute our “whole and complete good
[…] even in the judgment of an impartial reason,” because it is human
nature also to need happiness (5:110, 25). And happiness by itself
would not be unconditionally good, because moral virtue is a condition
of worthiness to be happy (5:111). So our unconditionally complete end
must combine both virtue and happiness. In Kant’s words, “virtue and
happiness together constitute possession of the highest good in a
person, and happiness distributed in exact proportion to morality (as
the worth of a person and his worthiness to be happy) constitutes the
&lt;em&gt;highest good&lt;/em&gt; of a possible world” (5:110–111). It is this ideal world
combining complete virtue with complete happiness that Kant normally
has in mind when he discusses the highest good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant says that we have a duty to promote the highest good, taken in
this sense (5:125). He does not mean, however, to be identifying some
new duty that is not derived from the moral law, in addition to all the
particular duties we have that are derived from the moral
 law.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-24" id="ref-24"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;
 For example, he
is not claiming that in addition to my duties to help others in need,
not to commit theft, etc., I also have the additional duty to represent
the highest good as the final end of all moral conduct, combined with
happiness, and to promote that end. Rather, as we have seen, Kant holds
that it is an unavoidable feature of human reasoning, instead of a
moral requirement, that we represent all particular duties as leading
toward the promotion of the highest good. So the duty to promote the
highest good is not a particular duty at all, but the sum of all our
duties derived from the moral law – it “does not increase the number of
morality’s duties but rather provides these with a special point of
reference for the unification of all ends” (6:5). Nor does Kant mean
that anyone has a duty to realize or actually bring about the highest
good through their own power, although his language sometimes suggests
this (5:113, 122). Rather, at least in his later works Kant claims that
only the common striving of an entire “ethical community” can actually
produce the highest good, and that the duty of individuals is to
promote (but not single-handedly produce) this end with all of their
strength by doing what the moral law commands (6:97–98,
 390–394).&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-25" id="ref-25"&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, according to Kant we must conceive of the highest good as a
possible state of affairs in order to fulfill our duty to promote it.
Here Kant does not mean that we unavoidably represent the highest good
as possible, since his view is that we must represent it as possible
only if we are to fulfill our duty of promoting it, and yet we may fail at
doing our duty. Rather, we have a choice about whether to conceive of
the highest good as possible, to regard it as impossible, or to remain
noncommittal (5:144–145). But we can fulfill our duty of promoting the
highest good only by choosing to conceive of the highest good as
possible, because we cannot promote any end without believing that it
is possible to achieve that end (5:122). So fulfilling the sum of all
moral duties to promote the highest good requires believing that a
world of complete virtue and happiness is not simply “a phantom of the
mind” but could actually be realized (5:472).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="PosPurPraRea"&gt;6.2 The postulates of pure practical reason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Kant argues that we can comply with our duty to promote the highest
good only if we believe in the immortality of the soul and the
existence of God. This is because to comply with that duty we must
believe that the highest good is possible, and yet to believe that the
highest good is possible we must believe that the soul is immortal and
that God exists, according to
 Kant.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-26" id="ref-26"&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Consider first Kant’s moral argument for belief in immortality. The
highest good, as we have seen, would be a world of complete morality
and happiness. But Kant holds that it is impossible for “a rational
being of the sensible world” to exhibit “complete conformity of
dispositions with the moral law,” which he calls “holiness,” because we
can never extirpate the propensity of our reason to give priority to
the incentives of inclination over the incentive of duty, which
propensity Kant calls radical evil (5:122, 6:37). Kant claims that
the moral law nevertheless requires holiness, however, and that it therefore
“can only be found in an endless progress toward that complete
conformity,” or progress that goes to infinity (5:122). This does not
mean that we can substitute endless progress toward complete conformity
with the moral law for holiness in the concept of the highest good, but
rather that we must represent that complete conformity as an infinite
progress toward the limit of holiness. Kant continues: “This endless
progress is, however, possible only on the presupposition of the
existence and personality of the same rational being continuing
endlessly (which is called the immortality of the soul). Hence the
highest good is practically possible only on the presupposition of the
immortality of the soul, so that this, as inseparable with the moral
law, is a postulate of pure practical reason” (ibid.). Kant’s idea is
not that we should imagine ourselves attaining holiness later although
we are not capable of it in this life. Rather, his view is that we must
represent holiness as continual progress toward complete conformity of
our dispositions with the moral law that begins in this life and
extends into infinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kant’s moral argument for belief in God in the &lt;em&gt;Critique of Practical
Reason&lt;/em&gt; may be summarized as follows. Kant holds that virtue and
happiness are not just combined but necessarily combined in the idea of
the highest good, because only possessing virtue makes one worthy of
happiness – a claim that Kant seems to regard as part of the content of
the moral law (4:393; 5:110, 124). But we can represent virtue and
happiness as necessarily combined only by representing virtue as the
efficient cause of happiness. This means that we must represent the
highest good not simply as a state of affairs in which everyone is both
happy and virtuous, but rather as one in which everyone is happy
because they are virtuous (5:113–114, 124). However, it is beyond the
power of human beings, both individually and collectively, to guarantee
that happiness results from virtue, and we do not know any law of
nature that guarantees this either. Therefore, we must conclude that
the highest good is impossible, unless we postulate “the existence of a
cause of nature, distinct from nature, which contains the ground of
this connection, namely the exact correspondence of happiness with
morality” (5:125). This cause of nature would have to be God since it
must have both understanding and will. Kant probably does not
conceive of God as the efficient cause of a happiness that is rewarded
in a future life to those who are virtuous in this one. Rather, his
view is probably that we represent our endless progress toward
holiness, beginning with this life and extending into infinity, as the
efficient cause of our happiness, which likewise begins in this life
and extends to a future one, in accordance with teleological laws that
God authors and causes to harmonize with efficient causes in nature
(A809–812/B837–840; 5:127–131, 447–450).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Both of these arguments are subjective in the sense that, rather than
attempting to show how the world must be constituted objectively in
order for the highest good to be possible, they purport to show only
how we must conceive of the highest good in order to be subjectively
capable both of representing it as possible and of fulfilling our duty
to promote it. But Kant also claims that both arguments have an
objective basis: first, in the sense that it cannot be proven
objectively either that immortality or God’s existence are impossible;
and, second, in the sense that both arguments proceed from a duty to
promote the highest good that is based not on the subjective character
of human reason but on the moral law, which is objectively valid for
all rational beings. So while it is not, strictly speaking, a duty to
believe in God or immortality, we must believe both in order to fulfill
our duty to promote the highest good, given the subjective character of
human reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To see why, consider what would happen if we did not believe in God or
immortality, according to Kant. In the &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt;, Kant
seems to say that this would leave us without any incentive to be
moral, and even that the moral law would be invalid without God and
immortality (A813/B841, A468/B496). But Kant later rejects this view
(8:139). His mature view is that our reason would be in conflict with
itself if we did not believe in God and immortality, because pure
practical reason would represent the moral law as authoritative for us
and so present us with an incentive that is sufficient to determine our
will; but pure theoretical (i.e., speculative) reason would undermine
this incentive by declaring morality an empty ideal, since it would not
be able to conceive of the highest good as possible (5:121, 143,
471–472, 450–453). In other words, the moral law would remain valid and
provide any rational being with sufficient incentive to act from duty,
but we would be incapable of acting as rational beings, since “it is a
condition of having reason at all […] that its principles and
affirmations must not contradict one another” (5:120). The only way to
bring speculative and practical reason “into that relation of equality
in which reason in general can be used purposively” is to affirm the
postulates on the grounds that pure practical reason has primacy over
speculative reason. This means, Kant explains, that if the capacity of
speculative reason “does not extend to establishing certain
propositions affirmatively, although they do not contradict it, as soon
as these same propositions belong inseparably to the practical interest
of pure reason it must accept them […,] being mindful, however, that
these are not its insights but are yet extensions of its use from
another, namely a practical perspective” (5:121). The primacy of
practical reason is a key element of Kant’s response to the crisis of
the Enlightenment, since he holds that reason deserves the sovereign
authority entrusted to it by the Enlightenment only on this basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="UniNatFre"&gt;7. The unity of nature and freedom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

This final section briefly discusses how Kant attempts to unify the
theoretical and practical parts of his philosophical system in the
&lt;em&gt;Critique of the Power of Judgment&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="GreCha"&gt;7.1 The great chasm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

In the Preface and Introduction to the &lt;em&gt;Critique of the Power of
Judgment&lt;/em&gt;, Kant announces that his goal in the work is to “bring
[his] entire critical enterprise to an end” by bridging the
“gulf” or “chasm” that separates the domain of
his theoretical philosophy (discussed mainly in the &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure
Reason&lt;/em&gt;) from the domain of his practical philosophy (discussed mainly
in the &lt;em&gt;Critique of Practical Reason&lt;/em&gt;) (5:170, 176, 195). In his words:
“The understanding legislates a priori for nature, as object of
the senses, for a theoretical cognition of it in a possible
experience. Reason legislates a priori for freedom and its own
causality, as the supersensible in the subject, for an unconditioned
practical cognition. The domain of the concept of nature under the one
legislation and that of the concept of freedom under the other are
entirely barred from any mutual influence that they could have on each
other by themselves (each in accordance with its fundamental laws) by
the great chasm that separates the supersensible from the
appearances” (5:195).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One way to understand the problem Kant is articulating here is to
consider it once again in terms of the crisis of the
 Enlightenment.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-27" id="ref-27"&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;
 The crisis was that
modern science threatened to undermine traditional moral and religious
beliefs, and Kant’s response is to argue that in fact these essential
interests of humanity are consistent with one another when reason is
granted sovereignty and practical reason is given primacy over
speculative reason. But the transcendental idealist framework within
which Kant develops this response seems to purchase the consistency of
these interests at the price of sacrificing a unified view of the world
and our place in it. If science applies only to appearances, while
moral and religious beliefs refer to things in themselves or “the
supersensible,” then how can we integrate these into a single
conception of the world that enables us to transition from the one
domain to the other? Kant’s solution is to introduce a third a priori
cognitive faculty, which he calls the reflecting power of judgment,
that gives us a teleological perspective on the world. Reflecting
judgment provides the concept of teleology or purposiveness that
bridges the chasm between nature and freedom, and thus unifies the
theoretical and practical parts of Kant’s philosophy into a single
system (5:196–197).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is important to Kant that a third faculty independent of both
understanding and reason provides this mediating perspective, because
he holds that we do not have adequate theoretical grounds for
attributing objective teleology to nature itself, and yet regarding
nature as teleological solely on moral grounds would only heighten the
disconnect between our scientific and moral ways of viewing the world.
Theoretical grounds do not justify us in attributing objective
teleology to nature, because it is not a condition of
self-consciousness that our understanding construct experience in
accordance with the concept of teleology, which is not among Kant’s
categories or the principles of pure understanding that ground the
fundamental laws of nature. That is why his theoretical philosophy
licenses us only in attributing mechanical causation to nature itself. To this limited extent, Kant is sympathetic to the dominant strain in modern
philosophy that banishes final causes from nature and instead treats
nature as nothing but matter in motion, which can be fully described
mathematically. But Kant wants somehow to reconcile this mechanistic
view of nature with a conception of human agency that is essentially
teleological. As we saw in the previous section, Kant holds that
every human action has an end and that the sum of all moral duties is
to promote the highest good. It is essential to Kant’s approach,
however, to maintain the autonomy of both understanding (in nature)
and reason (in morality), without allowing either to encroach on the
other’s domain, and yet to harmonize them in a single system. This
harmony can be orchestrated only from an independent standpoint, from
which we do not judge how nature is constituted objectively (that is
the job of understanding) or how the world ought to be (the job of
reason), but from which we merely regulate or reflect on our cognition
in a way that enables us to regard it as systematically unified.
According to Kant, this is the task of reflecting judgment, whose a
priori principle is to regard nature as purposive or teleological,
“but only as a regulative principle of the faculty of
cognition” (5:197).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="PurNat"&gt;7.2 The purposiveness of nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

In the &lt;em&gt;Critique of the Power of Judgment&lt;/em&gt;, Kant discusses four main
ways in which reflecting judgment leads us to regard nature as
purposive: first, it leads us to regard nature as governed by a system
of empirical laws; second, it enables us to make aesthetic judgments;
third, it leads us to think of organisms as objectively purposive; and,
fourth, it ultimately leads us to think about the final end of nature
as a
 whole.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-28" id="ref-28"&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, reflecting judgment enables us to discover empirical laws of
nature by leading us to regard nature as if it were the product of
intelligent design (5:179–186). We do not need reflecting judgment to
grasp the a priori laws of nature based on our categories, such as that
every event has a cause. But in addition to these a priori laws nature
is also governed by particular, empirical laws, such as that fire
causes smoke, which we cannot know without consulting experience. To
discover these laws, we must form hypotheses and devise experiments on
the assumption that nature is governed by empirical laws that we can
grasp (Bxiii–xiv). Reflecting judgment makes this assumption through
its principle to regard nature as purposive for our understanding,
which leads us to treat nature as if its empirical laws were designed
to be understood by us (5:180–181). Since this principle only regulates
our cognition but is not constitutive of nature itself, this does not
amount to assuming that nature really is the product of intelligent
design, which according to Kant we are not justified in believing on
theoretical grounds. Rather, it amounts only to approaching nature in
the practice of science as if it were designed to be understood by us.
We are justified in doing this because it enables us to discover
empirical laws of nature. But it is only a regulative principle of
reflecting judgment, not genuine theoretical knowledge, that nature is
purposive in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Second, Kant thinks that aesthetic judgments about both beauty and
sublimity involve a kind of purposiveness, and that the beauty of
nature in particular suggests to us that nature is hospitable to our
ends. According to his aesthetic theory, we judge objects to be
beautiful not because they gratify our desires, since aesthetic
judgments are disinterested, but rather because apprehending their form
stimulates what he calls the harmonious “free play” of our
understanding and imagination, in which we take a distinctively
aesthetic pleasure (5:204–207, 217–218, 287). So beauty is not a
property of objects, but a relation between their form and the way our
cognitive faculties work. Yet we make aesthetic judgments that claim
intersubjective validity because we assume that there is a common sense
that enables all human beings to communicate aesthetic feeling
(5:237–240, 293–296). Beautiful art is intentionally created to
stimulate this universally communicable aesthetic pleasure, although it
is effective only when it seems unintentional (5:305–307). Natural
beauty, however, is unintentional: landscapes do not know how to
stimulate the free play of our cognitive faculties, and they do not
have the goal of giving us aesthetic pleasure. In both cases, then,
beautiful objects appear purposive to us because they give us aesthetic
pleasure in the free play of our faculties, but they also do not appear
purposive because they either do not or do not seem to do this
intentionally. Kant calls this relation between our cognitive faculties
and the formal qualities of objects that we judge to be beautiful
“subjective purposiveness” (5:221). Although it is only subjective, the
purposiveness exhibited by natural beauty in particular may be
interpreted as a sign that nature is hospitable to our moral interests
(5:300). Moreover, Kant also interprets the experience of sublimity in
nature as involving purposiveness. But in this case it is not so much
the purposiveness of nature as our own purpose or “vocation” as moral
beings that we become aware of in the experience of the sublime, in which the
size and power of nature stand in vivid contrast to the superior
power of our reason (5:257–260, 267–269).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Third, Kant argues that reflecting judgment enables us to regard living
organisms as objectively purposive, but only as a regulative principle
that compensates for our inability to fully understand them mechanistically,
which reflects the limitations of our cognitive faculties rather than
any intrinsic teleology in nature. We cannot fully understand organisms
mechanistically because they are “self-organizing” beings, whose parts
are “combined into a whole by being reciprocally the cause and effect
of their form” (5:373–374). The parts of a watch are also possible only
through their relation to the whole, but that is because the watch is
designed and produced by some rational being. An organism, by contrast,
produces and sustains itself, which is inexplicable to us unless we
attribute to organisms purposes by analogy with human art (5:374–376).
But Kant claims that it is only a regulative principle of reflecting
judgment to regard organisms in this way, and that we are not justified
in attributing objective purposiveness to organisms themselves, since
it is only “because of the peculiar constitution of my cognitive
faculties [that] I cannot judge about the possibility of those things
and their generation except by thinking of a cause for these acts in
accordance with intentions” (5:397–398). Specifically, we cannot
understand how a whole can be the cause of its own parts because we
depend on sensible intuition for the content of our thoughts and
therefore must think the particular (intuition) first by subsuming it
under the general (a concept). To see that this is just a limitation of
the human, discursive intellect, imagine a being with an intuitive
understanding whose thought does not depend, as ours does, on receiving
sensory information passively, but rather creates the content of its
thought in the act of thinking it. Such a (divine) being could
understand how a whole can be the cause of its parts, since it could
grasp a whole immediately without first thinking particulars and then
combining them into a whole (5:401–410). Therefore, since we have a
discursive intellect and cannot know how things would appear to a being
with an intuitive intellect, and yet we can only think of organisms
teleologically, which excludes mechanism, Kant now says that we must
think of both mechanism and teleology only as regulative principles
that we need to explain nature, rather than as constitutive principles
that describe how nature is intrinsically constituted (5:410ff.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fourth, Kant concludes the &lt;em&gt;Critique of the Power of Judgment&lt;/em&gt; with a
long appendix arguing that reflecting judgment supports morality by
leading us to think about the final end of nature, which we can only
understand in moral terms, and that conversely morality reinforces a
teleological conception of nature. Once it is granted on theoretical
grounds that we must understand certain parts of nature (organisms)
teleologically, although only as a regulative principle of reflecting
judgment, Kant says we may go further and regard the whole of nature as
a teleological system (5:380–381). But we can regard the whole of
nature as a teleological system only by employing the idea of God,
again only regulatively, as its intelligent designer. This involves
attributing what Kant calls external purposiveness to nature – that is,
attributing purposes to God in creating nature (5:425). What, then, is
God’s final end in creating nature? According to Kant, the final end of
nature must be human beings, but only as moral beings (5:435, 444–445).
This is because only human beings use reason to set and pursue ends,
using the rest of nature as means to their ends (5:426–427). Moreover,
Kant claims that human happiness cannot be the final end of nature,
because as we have seen he holds that happiness is not unconditionally
valuable (5:430–431). Rather, human life has value not because of what
we passively enjoy, but only because of what we actively do (5:434). We
can be fully active and autonomous, however, only by acting morally,
which implies that God created the world so that human beings could
exercise moral autonomy. Since we also need happiness, this too may be
admitted as a conditioned and consequent end, so that reflecting
judgment eventually leads us to the highest good (5:436). But
reflection on conditions of the possibility of the highest good leads
again to Kant’s moral argument for belief in God’s existence, which in turn reinforces the teleological
perspective on nature with which reflecting judgment began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thus Kant argues that although theoretical and practical philosophy
proceed from separate and irreducible starting points –
self-consciousness as the highest principle for our cognition of
nature, and the moral law as the basis for our knowledge of freedom –
reflecting judgment unifies them into a single, teleological worldview
that assigns preeminent value to human autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="LifWor"&gt;1. Life and Works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Born in Edinburgh, Hume spent his childhood at Ninewells, his
family’s modest estate in the border lowlands. He came from a
“good family” (MOL 2)—socially well connected but
not wealthy. His father died just after David’s second birthday,
leaving him and his elder brother and sister in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
the care of our Mother, a woman of singular Merit, who, though young
and handsome, devoted herself entirely to the rearing and educating of
her Children. (MOL 3) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Katherine Falconer Hume realized that David was uncommonly precocious,
so when his older brother went up to Edinburgh University, Hume went
with him, although he was only 10 or 11. There he studied Latin and
Greek, read widely in history and literature, ancient and modern
philosophy, and also did some mathematics and natural
philosophy—what we now call natural science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The education David received, both at home and at the university,
aimed at training pupils to a life of virtue regulated by stern
Scottish Calvinist strictures. Prayers and sermons were prominent
aspects of his home and university life. At some point, Hume read
&lt;em&gt;The Whole Duty of Man&lt;/em&gt;, a widely circulated Anglican
devotional tract that details our duties to God, our fellow human
beings, and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume’s family thought him suited for a legal career, but he
found the law “nauseous”, preferring to read classical
texts, especially Cicero. He decided to become a “Scholar and
Philosopher”, and followed a rigorous program of reading and
reflection for three years until “there seem’d to be
open’d up to me a new Scene of Thought” (HL 3.2). The
intensity of developing his philosophical vision precipitated a
psychological crisis in the isolated scholar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The crisis eventually passed, and Hume remained intent on articulating
his “new Scene of Thought”. As a second son, his
inheritance was meager, so he moved to France, where he could live
cheaply, and finally settled in La Flèche, a sleepy village in
Anjou best known for its Jesuit college where Descartes and Mersenne
had studied a century before. Here he read French and other
continental authors, especially Malebranche, Dubos, and Bayle, and
occasionally baited the Jesuits with arguments attacking their
beliefs. By this time, Hume had not only rejected the religious
beliefs with which he was raised, but was also opposed to organized
religion in general, an opposition that remained constant throughout
his life. In 1734, when he was only 23, he began writing &lt;em&gt;A
Treatise of Human Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume returned to England in 1737 to ready the &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt; for
the press. To curry favor with Joseph Butler (1692–1752), he
“castrated” his manuscript, deleting his controversial
discussion of miracles, along with other “nobler parts”
(HL 6.2). Book I, “Of the Understanding”, and Book II,
“Of the Passions”, appeared anonymously in 1739. The next
year saw the publication of Book III, “Of Morals”, as well
as his anonymous “Abstract” of Books I and II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt; was no literary sensation, but it didn’t
fall “deadborn from the press” (MOL 6), as Hume
disappointedly described its reception. Despite his surgical
deletions, it attracted enough of “a Murmour among the
Zealots” (MOL 6) to fuel his lifelong reputation as an atheist
and a sceptic. When he applied for the Chair of Ethics and Pneumatical
(“Mental”) Philosophy at Edinburgh in 1745, his reputation
provoked vocal and ultimately successful opposition. Six years later,
he stood for the Chair of Logic at Glasgow, only to be turned down
again. Hume never held an academic post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 1745, he accepted a position as a young nobleman’s tutor,
only to discover that his charge was insane. A year later he became
secretary to his cousin, Lieutenant General James St Clair, eventually
accompanying him on an extended diplomatic mission in Austria and
Italy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 1748, &lt;em&gt;An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding&lt;/em&gt; appeared,
covering the central ideas of Book I of the &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt; and his
discussion of liberty and necessity from Book II. He also included
material he had excised from the &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt;. In 1751, he
published &lt;em&gt;An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals,&lt;/em&gt; a
“recasting” of Book III of the &lt;em&gt;Treatise,&lt;/em&gt; which he
described as “incomparably the best” of all his work (MOL
10). More essays, the &lt;em&gt;Political Discourses&lt;/em&gt;, appeared in 1752,
and Hume’s correspondence reveals that a draft of the
&lt;em&gt;Dialogues concerning Natural Religion&lt;/em&gt; was also underway at
this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An offer to serve as Librarian to the Edinburgh Faculty of Advocates
gave Hume the opportunity to begin another project, a &lt;em&gt;History of
England&lt;/em&gt;, using the law library’s excellent resources.
Published in six volumes between 1754 and 1762, his &lt;em&gt;History&lt;/em&gt;
was a bestseller well into the next century, giving him the financial
independence he had long sought. But even as a librarian, Hume’s
reputation as an atheist and sceptic dogged him. One of his orders for
“indecent Books” prompted an unsuccessful move for his
dismissal and excommunication from the Kirk. Friends and publishers
persuaded him to suppress some of his more controversial writings on
religion during his lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 1763, Hume accepted a position as private secretary to the British
Ambassador to France. During his three-year stay in Paris, he became
Secretary to the Embassy, and eventually its &lt;em&gt;chargé
d’affaires&lt;/em&gt;. He became the rage of the Parisian salons,
enjoying the conversation and company of famous European
intellectuals. He was known for his love of good food and wine, as
well as his enjoyment of the attentions and affections of women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume returned to Edinburgh in 1769. He built a house in
Edinburgh’s New Town, and spent his autumnal years quietly and
comfortably, dining and conversing with friends, not all of whom were
“studious and literary”, for he also found that his
“company was not unacceptable to the young and careless”
(MOL 21). He spent considerable time revising his works for new
editions of his &lt;em&gt;Essays and Treatises&lt;/em&gt;, which contained his
collected &lt;em&gt;Essays&lt;/em&gt;, the two &lt;em&gt;Enquiries&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A
Dissertation on the Passions&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Natural History of
Religion&lt;/em&gt;, but—significantly—not &lt;em&gt;A Treatise of
Human Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 1775, Hume was diagnosed with intestinal cancer. Before his death
in 1776, he arranged for the posthumous publication of his most
controversial work, the &lt;em&gt;Dialogues concerning Natural
Religion&lt;/em&gt;, and composed a brief autobiography, “My Own
Life”. Although there was much curiosity about how “the
great infidel” would face his death, his friends agreed that he
prepared himself with the same peaceful cheer that characterized his
life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="RelBetTreEnq"&gt;2. The relation between the &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Enquiries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 1775, as he was readying a revised edition of his &lt;em&gt;Essays and
Treatises&lt;/em&gt; for the press, Hume sent his publisher an
“Advertisement”, asking that it be included in this and
any subsequent edition of his works. In it, he complains that his
critics focused “all their batteries” on the
&lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt;, “that juvenile work”, which he
published anonymously and never acknowledged. He urges his readers to
regard the &lt;em&gt;Enquiries&lt;/em&gt; “as containing his philosophical
sentiments and principles”, assuring his publisher that they
provide “a compleat answer” to his critics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume’s apparent disavowal of the &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt; and his
regard for the &lt;em&gt;Enquiries&lt;/em&gt; raise a question about how we should
read his work. Should we take his statements literally and let the
&lt;em&gt;Enquiries&lt;/em&gt; represent his considered view, or should we ignore
his “Advertisement” and take the &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt; as the
best statement of his position?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Both options presuppose that the differences between the
&lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Enquiries&lt;/em&gt; are substantial enough to
warrant taking one or the other as best representing Hume’s
views, but there are good reasons for doubting this. Even in the
“Advertisement”, Hume says, “Most of the principles,
and reasonings, contained in this volume, were published” in the
&lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt;. He repeats his conviction that he was guilty of
“going to press too early”, and that his aim in the
&lt;em&gt;Enquiries&lt;/em&gt; was to “cast the whole anew … where
some negligences in his former reasoning and more in the expression,
are … corrected”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume’s description of his aims suggests another option. Rather
than repudiating the &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt;, perhaps his recasting of it
represents a shift in the way he presents his “principles and
reasoning” rather than a substantive change in what he has to
say. He reinforces this option when he says of the first
&lt;em&gt;Enquiry&lt;/em&gt; that the “philosophical Principles are the same
in both” and that “By shortening &amp;amp; simplifying the
Questions, I really render them much more complete” (HL 73.2).
He also comments in “My Own Life” that the
&lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt;’s lack of success “proceeded more from
the manner than the matter”—more from its
&lt;em&gt;structure&lt;/em&gt; than its content (MOL 8). It is not unreasonable to
conclude that Hume’s recasting of the &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt; was
designed to address this issue, which suggests that we might
understand him best by reading both works, despite their differences,
together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="PhiPro"&gt;3. Philosophical Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As the title of the &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt; proclaims, Hume’s subject
is human nature. He summarizes his project in its subtitle: “an
attempt to introduce the experimental method into moral
subjects”. In his day, “moral” meant anything
concerned with human nature, not just ethics, as he makes clear at the
beginning of the first &lt;em&gt;Enquiry&lt;/em&gt;, where he defines “moral
philosophy” as “the science of human nature” (EHU
1.1/5). Hume’s aim is to bring the scientific method to bear on
the study of human nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume’s early studies of philosophical “systems”
convinced him that philosophy was in a sorry state and in dire need of
reform. When he was only 18 years old, he complained in a letter that
anyone familiar with philosophy realizes that it is embroiled in
“endless Disputes” (HL 3.2). The ancient philosophers, on
whom he had been concentrating, replicated the errors their natural
philosophers made. They advanced theories that were “entirely
Hypothetical”, depending “more upon Invention than
Experience”. He objects that they consulted their imagination in
constructing their views about virtue and happiness, “without
regarding human Nature, upon which every moral Conclusion must
depend”. The youthful Hume resolved to avoid these mistakes in
his own work, by making human nature his “principal Study, &amp;amp;
the Source from which I would derive every Truth” (HL 3.6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even at this early stage, the roots of Hume’s mature approach to
the reform of philosophy are evident. He was convinced that the only
way to improve philosophy was to make the investigation of human
nature central—and empirical (HL 3.2). The problem with ancient
philosophy was its reliance on “hypotheses”—claims
based on speculation and invention rather than experience and
observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By the time Hume began to write the &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt; three years
later, he had immersed himself in the works of the modern
philosophers, but found them disturbing, not least because they made
the same mistakes the ancients did, while professing to avoid them.
Why, Hume asks, haven’t philosophers been able to make the
spectacular progress in understanding human nature that natural
philosophers—whom we now call
“scientists”—have recently achieved in the physical
sciences? His answer is that while scientists have cured themselves of
their “passion for hypotheses and systems”, philosophers
haven’t yet purged themselves of this temptation. Their theories
were too speculative, relied on &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; assumptions, and
paid too little attention to what human nature is actually like.
Instead of helping us understand ourselves, modern philosophers were
mired in interminable disputes—evident even to “the rabble
without doors”—giving rise to “the common prejudice
against metaphysical reasonings of all kinds”, that is,
“every kind of argument which is in any way abstruse, and
requires some attention to be comprehended” (T xiv.3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To make progress, Hume maintains, we need to “reject every
system … however subtle or ingenious, which is not founded on
fact and observation”. These systems, covering a wide range of
entrenched and influential metaphysical and theological views, purport
to have discovered principles that give us a deeper and more certain
knowledge of ultimate reality. But Hume argues that in attempting to
go beyond anything we can possibly experience, these metaphysical
theories try to “penetrate into subjects utterly inaccessible to
the understanding” (EHU 1.11/11), which makes their claims to
have found the “ultimate principles” of human nature not
just false, but unintelligible. These “airy sciences”, as
Hume calls them, have only the “air” of science (EHU
1.12/12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Worse still, these metaphysical systems are smokescreens for
“popular superstitions” that attempt to overwhelm us with
religious fears and prejudices (EHU 1.11/11). Hume has in mind a
variety of doctrines that need metaphysical cover to look
respectable—arguments for the existence of God, the immortality
of the soul, and the nature of God’s particular providence.
Metaphysics aids and abets these and other superstitious doctrines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But he insists that because these metaphysical and theological systems
are objectionable, it doesn’t mean we should give up doing
philosophy. Instead, we need to appreciate “the necessity of
carrying the war into the most secret recesses of the enemy”.
The only way to resist the allure of these pseudo–sciences is to
engage with them, countering their “abstruse …
metaphysical jargon” with “accurate and just
reasoning” (EHU 1.12/12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This means that the initial phase of Hume’s project must be
&lt;em&gt;critical&lt;/em&gt;. A prominent part of this aspect of his project is
to “discover the proper province of human
reason”—determining the extent and limits of
reason’s powers and capacities (EHU 1.12/12). He believes that
his investigation will show that metaphysics as the quest for
understanding the ultimate nature of reality is beyond reason’s
scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Scholars once emphasized this &lt;em&gt;critical phase&lt;/em&gt; at the expense
of the rest of Hume’s project, encouraging the charge that he
was just a negative skeptic, who rejects the views of others without
defending any positive position himself. But while he is indeed
skeptical about the possibility of metaphysical insights that go
deeper than science can, investigating the proper province of reason
isn’t only a critical activity. His critique of metaphysics
clears the way for the &lt;em&gt;constructive phase&lt;/em&gt; of his
project—the development of an empirical science of human
nature—and Hume is not at all skeptical about its prospects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In his “Introduction” to the &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt;, Hume
launches the constructive phase of his project by proposing nothing
less than “a compleat system of the sciences, built on a
foundation entirely new” (T xvi.6). The new foundation is the
scientific study of human nature. He argues that all the sciences have
some relation to human nature, “even Mathematics, Natural
Philosophy, and Natural Religion” (T xv.4). They are all human
activities, so what we are able to accomplish in them depends on
understanding what kinds of questions we are able to handle and what
sorts we must leave alone. If we have a better grasp of the scope and
limits of our understanding, the nature of our ideas, and the
operations we perform in reasoning about them, there is no telling
what improvements we might make in these sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We should expect even more improvement in the sciences that are more
closely connected to the study of human nature: “&lt;em&gt;Logic,
Morals, Criticism, and Politics&lt;/em&gt;”. Many longstanding
philosophical debates are about the nature of our
ideas—causation, liberty, virtue and beauty—so getting
clear about their content should help us cut through these
“endless disputes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As the science of human nature is the only solid foundation for the
other sciences, “the only solid foundation we can give to this
science itself must be laid on experience and observation” (T
xvi.7). Although Hume does not mention him by name, Newton
(1642–1727) is his hero. He accepts the Newtonian maxim
“&lt;em&gt;Hypotheses non fingo&lt;/em&gt;”, roughly, “I do not
do hypotheses”. Any laws we discover must be established by
observation and experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume is proposing an &lt;em&gt;empiricist&lt;/em&gt; alternative to traditional
&lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; metaphysics. His empiricism is &lt;em&gt;naturalistic&lt;/em&gt;
in that it refuses to countenance any appeal to the
&lt;em&gt;supernatural&lt;/em&gt; in the explanation of human nature. As a
naturalist, he aims to account for the way our minds work in a manner
that is consistent with a Newtonian picture of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume portrays his scientific study of human nature as a kind of
&lt;em&gt;mental geography&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;anatomy of the mind&lt;/em&gt; (EHU
1.13/13; T 2.1.12.2/326). In the first section of the first
&lt;em&gt;Enquiry&lt;/em&gt;, he says that it has two principal tasks, one purely
&lt;em&gt;descriptive&lt;/em&gt;, the other &lt;em&gt;explanatory&lt;/em&gt;. Mental geography
consists in delineating “the distinct parts and powers” of
the mind (EHU 1.13/3). While everyone can make some sense of the basic
distinctions among the mind’s contents and operations, more
fine–grained distinctions are harder to grasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume, however, wants to go much further. He wants to &lt;em&gt;explain&lt;/em&gt;
how the mind works by discovering its “secret springs and
principles”. He reminds us that astronomers, for a long time,
were content with proving the “motions, order, and magnitude of
the heavenly bodies”. But then “a
philosopher”—Newton—went beyond them and determined
“the laws and forces, by which the revolutions of the planets
are governed and directed” (EHU 1.15/14). Newton’s example
led other natural philosophers to similar explanatory successes. Hume
believes he will be equally successful in finding the fundamental laws
governing our “mental powers and economy”, if he follows
the same caution Newton exhibited in carrying out his inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Newton’s scientific method provides Hume with a template for
introducing the experimental method into his investigation of the
mind. In &lt;em&gt;An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals&lt;/em&gt;, he
says he will follow “a very simple method” that he
believes will bring about a transformation in the study of human
nature. Following Newton’s example, he argues that we should
“reject every system … however subtile or ingenious,
which is not founded on fact and observation”, and accept only
arguments derived from experience. When we inquire about human nature,
since we are asking “a question of fact, not of abstract
science”, we must rely on experience and observation (EPM
1.10/173–174).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As the fledgling Newton of the moral sciences, Hume wants to find a
set of laws that explain how the mind’s
contents—&lt;em&gt;perceptions&lt;/em&gt;, as he calls them—come and
go in the mind and how simple perceptions combine to form complex
perceptions in ways that explain human thought, belief, feeling and
action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Newton’s achievement was that he was able to explain diverse and
complex physical phenomena in terms of a few general principles. Like
him, Hume proposes to explain “all effects from the simplest and
fewest causes” (T xvii.8). He predicts that it is likely that
one “principle of the mind depends on another” and that
this principle may in turn be brought under another principle even
“more general and universal” (EHU 1.15/15). But he
emphasizes that while he will try to find the most general principles,
rendering them as universal as possible, all of his explanations must
be based completely on experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although philosophy, as an empirical enterprise, is itself bound by
experience, this is not a defect in the science of human nature. The
same is true for all the sciences: “None of them can go beyond
experience, or establish any principles which are not founded on that
authority” (T Intro 10). Explanations must come to an end
somewhere. When we see that we have “arriv’d at the utmost
extent of human reason, we sit down contented”, for the only
reason we can give for our most general principles is “our
experience of their reality” (T 9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume is Newtonian in much more than method. He sees that Newton is
significantly different from John Locke (1632–1704) and the
other Royal Society natural philosophers, because he rejects their
mechanist picture of the world. Newton’s greatest discovery, the
Law of Gravitation, is not a mechanical law. Hume explicitly models
his account of the fundamental principles of the mind’s
operations—the principles of association—on the idea of
gravitational attraction. By appealing to these same principles
throughout, Hume gives an explanation of these diverse phenomena that
enable him to provide a unified and economical account of the
mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="AccMin"&gt;4. Account of the Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To explain the workings of our minds with the economy Newton displayed
in his physics, Hume introduces the minimal amount of machinery he
thinks is necessary to account for the mind’s operations. Each
piece is warranted by experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The early modern period was the heyday of the investigation of the
ideas of causation, moral good and evil, and many other
philosophically contested ideas. Every modern philosopher accepted
some version of the &lt;em&gt;theory of ideas&lt;/em&gt;—the view that we
immediately perceive certain mental entities called &lt;em&gt;ideas&lt;/em&gt;,
but don’t have direct access to physical objects. Hume holds an
&lt;em&gt;empiricist&lt;/em&gt; version of the theory, because he thinks that
everything we believe is ultimately traceable to experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He begins with an account of &lt;em&gt;perceptions&lt;/em&gt;, because he believes
that any intelligible philosophical question must be asked and
answered in those terms. He uses &lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt; to designate any
mental content whatsoever, and divides perceptions into two
categories, &lt;em&gt;impressions&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ideas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Impressions&lt;/em&gt; include &lt;em&gt;sensations&lt;/em&gt; as well as
&lt;em&gt;desires&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;passions&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;emotions&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;em&gt;Ideas&lt;/em&gt; are “the faint images of these in thinking and
reasoning” (T 1.1.1.1/1). He thinks everyone will recognize his
distinction, since everyone is aware of the difference between
&lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt;. It is the difference between
&lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; the pain of your present sunburn and
&lt;em&gt;recalling&lt;/em&gt; last year’s sunburn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume distinguishes two kinds of impressions: &lt;em&gt;impressions of
sensation&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;original impressions&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;impressions
of reflection&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;secondary impressions&lt;/em&gt;. Impressions of
sensation include the feelings we get from our five senses as well as
pains and pleasures, all of which arise in us “originally, from
unknown causes” (T 1.1.2.1/7). He calls them &lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt;
because trying to determine their ultimate causes would take us beyond
anything we can experience. Any intelligible investigation must stop
with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Impressions of reflection include desires, emotions, passions, and
sentiments. They are essentially reactions or responses to ideas,
which is why he calls them &lt;em&gt;secondary&lt;/em&gt;. Your memories of last
year’s sunburn are ideas, copies of the original impressions you
had when the sunburn occurred. Recalling those ideas causes you to
&lt;em&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt; that you’ll get another sunburn this year, to
&lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; that you won’t, and to &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to take
proper precautions to avoid overexposure to the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Perceptions—both impressions and ideas—may be either
&lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;complex&lt;/em&gt;. Complex impressions are made up
of a group of simple impressions. My impression of the violet I just
picked is complex. Among the ways it affects my senses are its
brilliant purple color and its sweet smell. I can separate and
distinguish its color and smell from the rest of my impressions of the
violet. Its color and smell are simple impressions, which can’t
be broken down further because they have no component parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume initially distinguishes impressions and ideas in terms of their
degree of &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;vivacity&lt;/em&gt;. Impressions are more
forceful and vivacious than ideas. My impression of this ripe
tomato’s bright red color is as vivid as anything could be. Last
year’s tomatoes were just as vivid when I was looking at them,
but now my idea of them is much less vivid than my impressions of the
tomato in front of me. Since last year’s tomatoes were the same
color, the difference can’t be that they are different shades of
red; the difference must lie in the sharpness, clarity, and brightness
of my impressions—their &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;vivacity&lt;/em&gt;. At
various times, Hume tries other ways of characterizing the difference
between impressions and ideas, but he was never completely satisfied
with them. Still, what he says works well enough to give us a handle
on the felt differences between impressions and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When Hume distinguishes impressions and ideas in terms of their
relative force and vivacity, he is pointing out something that is
generally true of them as a matter of fact. On occasion, in dreams or
a high fever, ideas may approach the force and vivacity of
impressions, but these are exceptions that prove
the—empirical—rule. In general, impressions and ideas are
so different that no one can deny the distinction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although nothing seems freer than the power of thought, which
isn’t “restrained within the limits of nature and
reality” (EHU 2.4/18), Hume insists that our imagination is in
fact “confined within very narrow limits”. We can separate
and combine our ideas in new and even bizarre ways, imagining
creatures we’ve never seen or faraway galaxies, but all the
materials of thinking are ultimately derived from our impressions.
Since “all our ideas or more feeble perceptions are copies of
our impressions or more lively ones”; we are restricted to
“compounding, transporting, augmenting, or diminishing the
materials afforded us by the senses and experience” (EHU
2.5/19). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="CopPri"&gt;4.1 The Copy Principle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt;, Hume qualifies his claim that our ideas are
copies of our impressions, making clear that it applies only to the
relation between &lt;em&gt;simple ideas&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;simple
impressions&lt;/em&gt;. He offers this “general proposition”,
usually called the &lt;em&gt;Copy Principle&lt;/em&gt;, as his “first
principle … in the science of human nature”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All our simple ideas in their first appearance are deriv’d from
simple impressions, which are correspondent to them, and which they
exactly represent. (T 1.1.1.7/4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He presents the principle as something that everyone’s
experience confirms, but he also gives an argument to establish
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He argues first that there is a one–to–one correspondence
between simple ideas and simple impressions. He can’t
&lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; that this correspondence holds universally, since he
can’t examine every individual impression and idea. But he is so
confident the correspondence holds that he challenges anyone who
doubts it to produce an example of a simple impression without a
corresponding simple idea, or a simple idea without a corresponding
simple impression. Since he is certain they will fail, he concludes
that there is a &lt;em&gt;constant conjunction&lt;/em&gt; between simple
impressions and simple ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, he maintains that this constant conjunction is so universal that
the correspondence can’t be a matter of chance. There must be a
causal connection between them, but do ideas cause impressions or do
impressions cause ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, he argues that experience tells us that simple impressions
always precede and thus cause their corresponding ideas. To support
this claim, he appeals to two sorts of cases. First, if you want to
give a child an idea of the taste of pineapple, you give her a piece
of pineapple to eat. When you do, you are giving her an impression of
the pineapple’s taste. You never go the other way round. His
other case involves a person born blind, who won’t have ideas of
color because he won’t have impressions of color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Copy Principle is an empirical thesis, which he emphasizes by
offering “one contradictory phenomenon” as an empirical
counterexample to the principle. He imagines someone who has had the
same sorts of experiences of colors most of us have had, but has never
experienced a certain shade of blue. Hume thinks that if he orders all
the shades of blue he has experienced from the darkest to the
lightest, he will see immediately that there is a gap where the
missing shade should be. Then he asks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Whether ‘tis possible for him, from his own imagination, to
… raise up to himself the idea of that particular shade,
tho’ it had never been convey’d to him by his senses? I
believe there are few but will be of opinion that he can; and this may
serve as a proof, that the simple ideas are not always deriv’d
from the correspondent impressions; tho’ the instance is so
particular and singular, that ‘tis scarce worth our observing,
and does not merit that for it alone we shou’d alter our general
maxim. (T 1.1.1.10/6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume repeats the case of the missing shade almost verbatim in the
first &lt;em&gt;Enquiry&lt;/em&gt;. While scholars have wondered exactly how the
person might supply the missing shade, he seems unconcerned with the
details. For Hume, once again the exception proves
the—empirical—rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="HumAccDef"&gt;4.2 Hume’s Account of Definition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although Hume’s distinctive brand of empiricism is often
identified with his commitment to the Copy Principle, his use of the
principle’s reverse in his account of definition is perhaps the
more innovative element of his system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As his diagnosis of traditional metaphysics reveals, Hume believes
that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
the chief obstacle … to our improvement in the moral or
metaphysical sciences is the obscurity of the ideas, and ambiguity of
the terms. (EHU 7.1.2/61)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Conventional definitions—replacing terms with their
synonyms—merely replicate philosophical confusions and never
break out of a narrow definitional circle. Getting clear about the
content of the ideas and the meanings of the terms we are
investigating requires something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume argues that we must “pass from words to the true and real
subject of the controversy”—ideas. He believes he has
found a way to accurately determine their content—his account of
definition. He touts it as “a new microscope or species of
optics”, predicting that it will produce equally dramatic
results in the moral sciences as its hardware
counterparts—telescopes and microscopes—have produced in
natural philosophy (EHU 7.1.4/62).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume’s account of definition uses a simple series of tests to
determine cognitive content. Begin with a term. Ask what idea is
annexed to it. If there is no such idea, then the term has no
cognitive content, however prominently it figures in philosophy or
theology. If there is an idea annexed to the term, and it is complex,
break it down into the simple ideas that compose it, and trace them
back to their original impressions. If the process fails at any point,
the idea in question lacks cognitive content. When carried through
successfully, however, it yields a “just
definition”—a precise account of the troublesome
idea’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume uses his account of definition in the &lt;em&gt;critical phase&lt;/em&gt;of
his project to show that many of the central concepts of traditional
metaphysics lack intelligible content. He also uses it in the
&lt;em&gt;constructive phase&lt;/em&gt; to determine the exact meaning of our
terms and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="PriAss"&gt;4.3 Principles of Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although we are capable of separating and combining our simple ideas
as we please, there is, nevertheless, a regular order to our thoughts.
If ideas occurred to us completely randomly, so that all our thoughts
were “loose and unconnected”, we wouldn’t be able to
think coherently (T 1.1.4.1/10). This suggests that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is a secret tie or union among particular ideas, which causes
the mind to conjoin them more frequently, and makes the one, upon its
appearance, introduce the other. (Abstract 35)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume explains this “tie or union” in terms of the
mind’s natural ability to &lt;em&gt;associate&lt;/em&gt; certain ideas.
Association is not “an inseparable connexion”, but rather
“a gentle force, which commonly prevails”, by means of
which one idea naturally introduces another (T 1.1.4.1/10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the first &lt;em&gt;Enquiry&lt;/em&gt;, Hume says that even though it is
obvious to everyone that our ideas are connected in this way, he is
the first philosopher who has “attempted to enumerate or class
all the principles of association” (EHU 3.2/24). He regards his
use of these “universal principles” as so distinctive that
he advertises them as his most original contribution—one that
entitles him call himself an “&lt;em&gt;inventor&lt;/em&gt;” (Abstract
35).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume identifies three principles of association: &lt;em&gt;resemblance&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;contiguity in time and place, and causation.&lt;/em&gt; When someone
shows you a picture of your best friend, you naturally think of her
because the picture &lt;em&gt;resembles&lt;/em&gt; her. When you’re reminded
of something that happened in the 1960s—miniskirts, for
example—you may think of the Vietnam War, because they are
&lt;em&gt;temporally contiguous&lt;/em&gt;. Thinking of Sausalito may lead you to
think of the Golden Gate Bridge, which may lead you to think of San
Francisco, since they are &lt;em&gt;spatially contiguous&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;em&gt;Causality&lt;/em&gt; works both from cause to effect and effect to
cause: meeting someone’s father may make you think of his son;
encountering the son may lead you to thoughts of his father. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of the three associative principles, &lt;em&gt;causation&lt;/em&gt; is the
strongest, and the only one that takes us “beyond our
senses” (T 1.3.2.3/74). It establishes links between our present
and past experiences and our expectations about the future, so that
“all reasonings concerning matters of fact seem to be founded on
the relation of &lt;em&gt;Cause&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Effect&lt;/em&gt;” (EHU
4.1.4/26). Taking aspirin in the past has relieved my headaches, so I
expect that the aspirin I just took will soon relieve my present
headache. Hume also makes clear that causation is the least understood
of the associative principles, but he tells us, “we shall have
occasion afterwards to examine it to the bottom” (T
1.1.4.2/11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Like gravitational attraction, the associative principles are
&lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt;, and so can’t be explained further. Although
the associative principles’ “effects are everywhere
conspicuous” their causes “are mostly unknown, and must be
resolv’d into &lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt; qualities of human nature, which
I pretend not to explain”. Accordingly, we should curb any
“intemperate desire” to account further for them, for
doing so would take us illegitimately beyond the bounds of experience
(T 1.1.4.6/12–13).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume doesn’t try to explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we associate ideas as
we do. He is interested only in establishing that, as a matter of
fact, we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; associate ideas in these ways. Given that his
claim that the associative principles explain the important operations
of the mind is an empirical one, he must admit, as he does in the
first &lt;em&gt;Enquiry&lt;/em&gt;, that he cannot prove conclusively that his
list of associative principles is complete. Perhaps he has overlooked
some additional principle. We are free to examine our own thoughts to
determine whether resemblance, contiguity, and causation successfully
explain them. The more instances the associative principles explain,
the more assurance we have that Hume has identified the basic
principles by which our minds work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the &lt;em&gt;Abstract&lt;/em&gt;, Hume concludes that it should be “easy
to conceive of what vast consequences these principles must be in the
science of human nature”. Since they “are the only ties of
our thoughts, they are really &lt;em&gt;to us&lt;/em&gt; the cement of the
universe, and all the operations of the mind must, in great measure,
depend on them” (Abstract 35). Just what these “vast
consequences” are will become clear when we examine Hume’s
revolutionary accounts of our causal inferences and moral
judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="Cau"&gt;5. Causation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The medieval synthesis Thomas Aquinas (1224–74) forged between
Christian theology and Aristotle’s science and metaphysics set
the terms for the early modern causation debate. Aristotle
(384–322 BCE) drew an absolute categorical distinction between
scientific knowledge (&lt;em&gt;scientia&lt;/em&gt;) and belief (&lt;em&gt;opinio&lt;/em&gt;).
Scientific knowledge was knowledge of causes and scientific
explanation consisted in &lt;em&gt;demonstration&lt;/em&gt;—proving the
&lt;em&gt;necessary connection&lt;/em&gt; between a cause and its effect from
intuitively obvious premises independently of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Modern philosophers thought of themselves as scientific
revolutionaries because they rejected Aristotle’s account of
causation. Even so, they accepted his distinction between knowledge
and belief, and regarded causal inference as an exercise of reason,
which aimed at demonstrating the necessary connection between cause
and effect. Malebranche (1638–1715), and others following
Descartes (1596–1650), were optimistic about the possibility of
demonstrative scientific knowledge, while those in the British
experimental tradition were more pessimistic. Locke was sufficiently
sceptical about what knowledge we can attain that he constructed one
of the first accounts of probable inference to show that belief can
meet standards of rationality that make experimental natural
philosophy intellectually respectable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When Hume enters the debate, he translates the traditional distinction
between knowledge and belief into his own terms, dividing “all
the objects of human reason or enquiry” into two exclusive and
exhaustive categories: &lt;em&gt;relations of ideas&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;matters of
fact&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Propositions concerning &lt;em&gt;relations of ideas&lt;/em&gt; are intuitively or
demonstratively certain. They are known &lt;em&gt;a
priori&lt;/em&gt;—discoverable independently of experience by
“the mere operation of thought”, so their truth
doesn’t depend on anything actually existing (EHU 4.1.1/25).
&lt;em&gt;That the interior angles of a Euclidean triangle sum to 180
degrees&lt;/em&gt; is true whether or not there are any Euclidean triangles
to be found in nature. Denying that proposition is a contradiction,
just as it is contradictory to say that 8×7=57.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In sharp contrast, the truth of propositions concerning &lt;em&gt;matters of
fact&lt;/em&gt; depends on the way the world is. Their contraries are always
possible, their denials never imply contradictions, and they
can’t be established by demonstration. Asserting that &lt;em&gt;Miami
is north of Boston&lt;/em&gt; is false, but not contradictory. We can
understand what someone who asserts this is saying, even if we are
puzzled about how he could have the facts so wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The distinction between &lt;em&gt;relations of ideas&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;matters of
fact&lt;/em&gt; is often called “Hume’s Fork”, generally
with the negative implication that Hume may be illicitly ruling out
meaningful propositions that don’t fit into these two categories
or fit into both of them. To defuse this objection, however, it is
important to bear in mind that Hume’s categories are his
translations of a traditional absolute categorical classificatory
distinction, which all his contemporaries and immediate predecessors
accepted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume’s method dictates his strategy in the causation debate. In
the &lt;em&gt;critical phase&lt;/em&gt;, he argues that his predecessors were
wrong: our causal inferences aren’t determined by “reason
or any other operation of the understanding” (EHU 5.1.2/41). In
the &lt;em&gt;constructive phase&lt;/em&gt;, he supplies an alternative: the
associative principles are their basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume’s contributions to the &lt;em&gt;critical phase&lt;/em&gt; of the
causation debate are contained in &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt; 1.3.6 and Section
4 of the first &lt;em&gt;Enquiry&lt;/em&gt;, appropriately titled “Sceptical
doubts concerning the operations of the understanding”. The
&lt;em&gt;constructive phase&lt;/em&gt; in his &lt;em&gt;Enquiry&lt;/em&gt; account is the
following section, also appropriately titled “Sceptical solution
of these doubts”, while the corresponding sections of the
&lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt; stretch from 1.3.7 through 1.3.10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="CauInfCriPha"&gt;5.1 Causal Inference: Critical Phase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Causal inferences are the only way we can go beyond the evidence of
our senses and memories. In making them, we suppose there is some
&lt;em&gt;connection&lt;/em&gt; between present facts and what we infer from them.
But what is this connection? How is it established?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the connection is established by an operation of reason or the
understanding, it must concern either &lt;em&gt;relations of ideas&lt;/em&gt; or
&lt;em&gt;matters of fact&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume argues that the connection can’t involve relations of
ideas. Effects are different events from their causes, so there is no
contradiction in conceiving of a cause occurring, and its usual effect
not occurring. Ordinary causal judgments are so familiar that we tend
to overlook this; they seem immediate and intuitive. But suppose you
were suddenly brought into the world as an adult, armed with the
intellectual firepower of an Einstein. Could you, simply by examining
an aspirin tablet, determine that it will relieve your headache?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When we reason &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;, we consider the idea of the object
we regard as a cause independently of any observations we have made of
it. It can’t include the idea of any other &lt;em&gt;distinct&lt;/em&gt;
object, including the object we take to be its usual effect. But then
it can’t show us any “inseparable and inviolable
connection”—any &lt;em&gt;necessary
connection&lt;/em&gt;—between those ideas. Trying to reason &lt;em&gt;a
priori&lt;/em&gt; from your idea of an aspirin, without including any
information you have of its effects from your previous experience,
yields only your simple ideas of its “sensible
qualities”—its size, shape, weight, color, smell, and
taste. It gives you no idea of what “secret powers” it
might have to produce its usual effects. Hume concludes that &lt;em&gt;a
priori&lt;/em&gt; reasoning can’t be the source of the connection
between our ideas of a cause and its effect. Contrary to what the
majority of his contemporaries and immediate predecessors thought,
causal inferences do not concern relations of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume now moves to the only remaining possibility. If causal inferences
don’t involve &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; reasoning about relations of
ideas, they must concern matters of fact and experience. When
we’ve had many experiences of one kind of event constantly
conjoined with another, we begin to think of them as cause and effect
and infer the one from the other. But even after we’ve had many
experiences of a cause conjoined with its effect, our inferences
aren’t determined by reason or any other operation of the
understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the past, taking aspirin has relieved my headaches, so I believe
that taking aspirin will relieve the headache I’m having now.
But my inference is based on the aspirin’s superficial sensible
qualities, which have nothing to do with headache relief. Even if I
assume that the aspirin has “secret powers” that are doing
the heavy lifting in relieving my headache, they can’t be the
basis of my inference, since these “secret powers” are
unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nonetheless, Hume observes, “we always presume, when we see like
sensible qualities, that they have like secret powers, and expect that
effects, similar to those we have experienced, will follow from
them” (EHU 4.2.16/33). Since we neither intuit nor infer &lt;em&gt;a
priori&lt;/em&gt; that similar objects have similar secret powers, our
presumption must be based in some way on our experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But our past experience only gives us information about objects as
they were when we experienced them, and our present experience only
tells us about objects we are experiencing now. Causal inferences,
however, do not just &lt;em&gt;record&lt;/em&gt; our past and present experiences.
They &lt;em&gt;extend&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt; what we have gathered from
experience to other objects in the future. Since it is not necessarily
true that an object with the same sensible qualities will have the
same secret powers that past objects with those sensible qualities
had, how do we project those experiences into the future, to other
objects that may only appear similar to those we’ve previously
experienced?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume thinks we can get a handle on this question by considering two
clearly different propositions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="sentag tag3em"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="tag"&gt;(1)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sen"&gt; I’ve found
that headache relief has always followed my taking
aspirin;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="sentag tag3em"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="tag"&gt; (2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sen"&gt; Taking aspirin
similar to the ones I’ve taken in the past will relieve my
present headache.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is no question that “the one proposition may be justly
inferred from the other”, and that “it is always
inferred”. But since their connection obviously isn’t
intuitive, Hume challenges us to produce the “chain of
reasoning” that takes us from propositions like (1) to
propositions like (2) (EHU 4.2.16/34).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(1) summarizes my past experience, while (2) predicts what will happen
in the immediate future. The chain of reasoning I need must show me
how my past experience is relevant to my future experience. I need
some further proposition or propositions that will establish an
appropriate &lt;em&gt;link&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;connection&lt;/em&gt; between past and
future, and take me from (1) to (2) using either &lt;em&gt;demonstrative
reasoning&lt;/em&gt;, concerning relations of ideas, or &lt;em&gt;probable
reasoning&lt;/em&gt;, concerning matters of fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume thinks it is evident that demonstrative reasoning can’t
bridge the gap between (1) and (2). However unlikely it may be, we can
always intelligibly conceive of a change in the course of nature. Even
though aspirin relieved my previous headaches, there’s no
contradiction in supposing that it won’t relieve the one
I’m having now, so the supposition of a change in the course of
nature can’t be proven false by any reasoning concerning
relations of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That leaves probable reasoning. Hume argues that there is no probable
reasoning that can provide a just inference from past to future. Any
attempt to infer (2) from (1) by a probable inference will be
viciously circular—it will involve supposing what we are trying
to prove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume spells out the circularity this way. Any reasoning that takes us
from (1) to (2) must employ some &lt;em&gt;connecting principle&lt;/em&gt; that
connects the past with the future. Since one thing that keeps us from
moving directly from past to future is the possibility that the course
of nature might change, it seems plausible to think that the
connecting principle we need will be one that will assure us that
nature is &lt;em&gt;uniform&lt;/em&gt;—that the course of nature won’t
change—something like this &lt;em&gt;uniformity principle&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="sentag tag3em"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="tag"&gt;[UP]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sen"&gt;The future will be
like the past.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Adopting [UP] will indeed allow us to go from (1) to (2). But before
we can use it to establish that our causal inferences are determined
by reason, we need to determine our basis for adopting it. [UP] is
clearly not &lt;em&gt;intuitive&lt;/em&gt;, nor is it &lt;em&gt;demonstrable&lt;/em&gt;, as
Hume has already pointed out, so only &lt;em&gt;probable&lt;/em&gt; arguments
could establish it. But to attempt to establish [UP] this way would be
to try to establish probable arguments using probable arguments, which
will eventually include [UP] itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At this point, Hume has exhausted the ways reason might establish a
connection between cause and effect. He assures us that he offers his
“sceptical doubts” not as a “discouragement, but
rather an incitement … to attempt something more full and
satisfactory”. Having cleared the way for his constructive
account, Hume is ready to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="CauInfConPha"&gt;5.2 Causal Inference: Constructive Phase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume calls his constructive account of causal inference a
“sceptical solution” to the “sceptical doubts”
he raised in the critical phase of his argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since we’re determined—&lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt;—to make
causal inferences, then if they aren’t “determin’d
by reason”, there must be “some principle of equal weight
and authority” that leads us to make them. Hume maintains that
this principle is &lt;em&gt;custom&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;habit&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
whenever the repetition of any particular act or operation produces a
propensity to renew the same act or operation … we always say,
that this propensity is the effect of &lt;em&gt;Custom&lt;/em&gt;. (EHU
5.1.5/43)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is therefore custom, not reason, which “determines the mind
… to suppose the future conformable to the past”
(Abstract 16). But even though we have located the principle, it is
important to see that this isn’t a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; principle by
which our minds operate. &lt;em&gt;Custom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;habit&lt;/em&gt; are
general names for the principles of association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume describes their operation as a causal process: custom or habit is
the cause of the particular propensity you form after your repeated
experiences of the constant conjunction of smoke and fire. Causation
is the operative associative principle here, since it is the only one
of those principles that can take us beyond our senses and
memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume concludes that custom alone “makes us expect for the
future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in
the past” (EHU 5.1.6/44). Custom thus turns out to be the source
of the &lt;em&gt;Uniformity Principle&lt;/em&gt;—the belief that the future
will be like the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="Bel"&gt;5.3 Belief&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Causal inference leads us not only to &lt;em&gt;conceive&lt;/em&gt; of the effect,
but also to &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;/em&gt; it. When I expect that aspirin will
relieve my headache, I’m not just abstractly considering the
idea of headache relief, I &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; that aspirin will relieve
it. What more is involved in &lt;em&gt;believing&lt;/em&gt; that aspirin will
relieve my headache than in merely &lt;em&gt;conceiving&lt;/em&gt; that it
will?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It can’t be that beliefs have some additional idea—the
idea of belief, perhaps—that conceptions lack. If there were
some such idea, given our ability to freely combine ideas, we could,
by simply willing, add that idea to any conception whatsoever, and
believe anything we like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume concludes that belief must be some sentiment or feeling aroused
in us independently of our wills, which accompanies those ideas that
constitute them. It is a particular way or manner of conceiving an
idea that is generated by the circumstances in which we find
ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If constant conjunctions were all that is involved, my thoughts about
aspirin and headaches would only be hypothetical. For belief, one of
the conjoined objects must be present to my senses or memories; I must
be taking, or just have taken, an aspirin. In these circumstances,
believing that my headache will soon be relieved is as unavoidable as
feeling affection for a close friend, or anger when someone harms us.
“All these operations are species of natural instincts, which no
reasoning … is able either to produce or prevent” (EHU
5.1.8/46–47).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While Hume thinks that &lt;em&gt;defining&lt;/em&gt; this sentiment may be
impossible, we can &lt;em&gt;describe&lt;/em&gt; belief, if only by analogy,
although he was never completely satisfied with his attempts to do so.
Belief is a livelier, firmer, more vivid, steady, and intense
conception of an object. Hume intends these characterizations to go
beyond merely recording intensity of feeling to capture how belief&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
renders realities … more present to us than fictions, causes
them to weigh more in the thought, and gives them a superior influence
on the passions and imagination. (EHU 5.2.12/49)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But how does an idea come to be conceived in such a manner that it
constitutes a belief?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume’s explanation is that as I become accustomed to
aspirin’s relieving my headaches, I develop a propensity—a
tendency—to expect headache relief to follow taking aspirin. The
propensity is due to the associative bond that my repeated experiences
of taking aspirin and headache relief have formed. My present
impressions of taking an aspirin are as forceful and vivid as anything
could be, and some of their force and vivacity transfers across the
associative path to the idea of headache relief, enlivening it with
enough force and vivacity to give it the “strength and
solidity” that constitutes belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since I don’t know how aspirin relieves headaches, it is
fortunate that there is “a kind of pre-established harmony
between the course of nature and the succession of our ideas”
that teaches me to take aspirin when I have a headache. Custom, Hume
maintains, in language that anticipates and influenced Darwin,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
is that principle by which this correspondence has been effected; so
necessary to the subsistence of our species, and the regulation of our
conduct, in every circumstance of human life. (EHU 5.2.21/55)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is far better, Hume concludes, to rely on “the ordinary
wisdom of nature”, which ensures that we form beliefs “by
some instinct or mechanical tendency”, rather than trusting it
to “the fallacious deductions of our reason” (EHU
5.2.22/55).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In keeping with his project of providing a naturalistic account of how
our minds work, Hume has given empirical explanations of our
propensity to make causal inferences, and the way those inferences
lead to belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="IdeNecCon"&gt;6. The Idea of Necessary Connection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The early modern causation debate revolved around a family of
“nearly synonymous” key ideas, the most prominent of which
were the ideas of &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;necessary connection&lt;/em&gt;.
For Hume, “there are no ideas, which occur in metaphysics, more
obscure and uncertain”. He showcases the critical and
constructive uses of his account of definition as he attempts
“to fix … the precise meaning of these terms”, in
order to “remove some part of that obscurity, which is so much
complained of in this species of philosophy” (EHU
7.1.3/61–62).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="NecConCriPha"&gt;6.1 Necessary Connection: Critical Phase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To get clear about the idea of power or necessary connection, we need
to determine the impressions that are its source. Hume identifies
three possible sources in the work of his predecessors: Locke thought
we get our idea of power secondarily from &lt;em&gt;external
impressions&lt;/em&gt; of the interactions of physical objects, and
primarily from &lt;em&gt;internal impressions&lt;/em&gt; of our ability to move
our bodies and to consider ideas. Malebranche argued that what we take
to be causes of the motion of bodies or mental activity aren’t
causes at all. They are only &lt;em&gt;occasions&lt;/em&gt; for God, the sole
source of necessary connection, to act in the world. Hume rejects all
three possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He argues that &lt;em&gt;external impressions&lt;/em&gt; of the interactions of
bodies can’t give rise to our idea of power. When we see that
the motion of one billiard ball follows another, we’re only
observing their &lt;em&gt;conjunction&lt;/em&gt;, never their
&lt;em&gt;connection&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Attending to &lt;em&gt;internal impressions&lt;/em&gt; of the operations of our
minds doesn’t help. Although voluntary bodily movements follow
our willing that those movements occur, this is a matter of fact I
learn through experience, not from some internal impression of my
will’s power. When I decide to type, my fingers move over the
keyboard. When I decide to stop, they stop, but I have no idea how
this happens. Were I aware of the power of my will to move my fingers,
I’d know both how it worked and its limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our ability to control our thoughts doesn’t give us an
impression of power, either. We don’t have a clue about how we
call up our ideas. Our command over them is limited and varies from
time to time. We learn about these limitations and variations only
through experience, but the mechanisms by which they operate are
unknown and incomprehensible to us. If I decide to think about
Istanbul, my idea of that city comes to mind, but I experience only
the succession of my decision followed by the idea’s appearance,
never the power itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When ordinary people can’t determine an event’s cause,
they attribute it to some “invisible intelligent
principle”. Malebranche and other occasionalists do the same,
except they apply it across the board. True causes aren’t
powers in the physical world or in human minds. The only true cause is
God’s willing that certain objects should always be conjoined
with certain others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyone aware of our minds’ narrow limits should realize that
Malebranche’s theory takes us into
“fairyland”—it goes so far beyond our experience
that we have no way of intelligibly assessing it. It also capitalizes
on how little we know about the interactions of bodies, but since our
idea of God is based on extrapolations from our faculties, our
ignorance should also apply to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="NecConConPha"&gt;6.2 Necessary Connection: Constructive Phase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since we’ve canvassed the leading contenders for the source of
our idea of necessary connection and found them wanting, it might
&lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; as if we have no such idea, but that would be too hasty.
In our discussion of causal inference, we saw that when we find that
one kind of event is constantly conjoined with another, we begin to
expect the one to occur when the other does. We suppose there’s
some connection between them, and don’t hesitate to call the
first, the &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt;, and the second, the &lt;em&gt;effect&lt;/em&gt;. We
also saw that there’s nothing different in the repetition of
constantly conjoined cases from the exactly similar single case,
&lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; that after we’ve experienced their constant
conjunction, habit determines us to expect the effect when the cause
occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume concludes that it is just this felt determination of the
mind—our awareness of this customary transition from one
associated object to another—that is the source of our idea of
necessary connection. When we say that one object is necessarily
connected with another, we really mean that the objects have acquired
an associative connection in our thought that gives rise to this
inference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having located the missing ingredient, Hume is ready to offer a
definition of &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, he gives us two. The first,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A cause is an object, followed by another, where all the objects
similar to the first are followed by objects similar to the
second,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
gives the relevant &lt;em&gt;external impressions&lt;/em&gt;, while the
second,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A cause is an object followed by another, and whose appearance always
conveys the thought to the other,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
captures the &lt;em&gt;internal impression&lt;/em&gt;—our awareness of being
determined by custom to move from cause to effect. Both are
definitions on Hume’s account, but his “just
definition” of our idea of cause is the conjunction of the two
(EHU 7.2.29/76–77). Only together do they capture &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;
the relevant impressions involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume locates the source of the idea of necessary connection &lt;em&gt;in
us&lt;/em&gt;, not in the objects themselves or even in our ideas of those
objects we regard as causes and effects. In doing so, he completely
changes the course of the causation debate, reversing what everyone
else thought about the idea of necessary connection. Subsequent
discussions of causation must confront the challenges Hume poses for
traditional, more metaphysical, ways of looking at our idea of
causation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume’s treatment of our idea of causation is his flagship
illustration of how his method works and the revolutionary results it
can achieve. He goes on to apply both his method, and its concrete
results, to other prominent debates in the modern period, including
probable inference, testimony for miracles, free will, and intelligent
design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="Mor"&gt;7. Moral Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume’s explanation of morality is an important part of his
efforts to reform philosophy. He takes his primary task to be an
investigation into the origin of the basic moral ideas, which he
assumes are the ideas of moral goodness and badness. As with the idea
of cause and necessary connection, he wants to explain moral ideas as
economically as possible in terms of their “simplest and fewest
causes”. Determining their causes will determine what their
content is—what we mean by them. His secondary concern is to
establish what character traits and motives are morally good and
bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume follows his sentimentalist predecessor, Francis Hutcheson
(1694–1746), in building his moral theory around the idea of a
spectator who approves or disapproves of people’s character
traits and motives. The sentiments of approval and disapproval are the
source of our moral ideas of goodness and badness. To evaluate a
character trait as morally good is to evaluate it as virtuous; to
evaluate it as morally bad is to evaluate it as vicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As he did in the causation debate, Hume steps into an ongoing debate
about ethics, often called the British Moralists debate, which began
in the mid-seventeenth century and continued until the end of the
eighteenth. He uses the same method here as he did in the causation
debate: there is a &lt;em&gt;critical phase&lt;/em&gt; in which he argues against
his opponents, and a &lt;em&gt;constructive phase&lt;/em&gt; in which he
develops his version of sentimentalism. Hume has two sets of
opponents: the self-love theorists and the moral rationalists. He
became the most famous proponent of sentimentalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thomas Hobbes’ (1588–1679) radical attempt to derive moral
and political obligation from motives of self-interest initiated the
British Moralists debate. Hobbes, as his contemporaries understood
him, characterizes us as naturally self-centered and power-hungry,
concerned above all with our own preservation. In the state of nature,
a pre-moral and pre-legal condition, we seek to preserve ourselves by
trying to dominate others. Since we are all sufficiently
“equal” in power, this results in a state of “war of
all against all” in which life is “nasty, brutish, and
short” (&lt;em&gt;Leviathan&lt;/em&gt;, Ch. 13).  The way out is to make a
compact with one another. We agree to hand over our power and freedom
to a sovereign, who makes the laws necessary for us to live together
peacefully and has the power to enforce them. While acting morally
requires that we comply with the laws the sovereign establishes, the
basis of morality is self-interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bernard Mandeville’s (1670–1733) &lt;em&gt;The Fable of the
Bees&lt;/em&gt; served to reinforce this reading of Hobbes during the early
18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. According to Mandeville, human beings are
naturally selfish, headstrong, and unruly. Some clever politicians,
recognizing that we would be better off living together in a civilized
society, took up the task of domesticating us. Realizing that we are
proud creatures, highly susceptible to flattery, they were able to
dupe many of us to live up to the ideal of virtue—conquering our
selfish passions and helping others—by dispensing praise and
blame. Moral concepts are just tools clever politicians used to tame
us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Two kinds of moral theories developed in reaction first to Hobbes and
then to Mandeville—rationalism and sentimentalism. The
rationalists oppose Hobbes’ claim that there is no right or
wrong in the state of nature, that rightness or wrongness is
determined by the sovereign’s will, and that morality requires
sanctions to motivate us. The sentimentalists object to Hobbes’
and Mandeville’s “selfish” conceptions of human
nature and morality. By the mid–eighteenth century, rationalists
and sentimentalists were arguing not only against Hobbes and
Mandeville, but also with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume opposes both selfish and rationalist accounts of morality, but he
criticizes them in different works. In the &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt;, Hume
assumes that Hobbes’ theory is no longer a viable option, so
that there are only two possibilities to consider. Either moral
concepts spring from reason, in which case rationalism is correct, or
from sentiment, in which case sentimentalism is correct. If one falls,
the other stands. In the second &lt;em&gt;Enquiry,&lt;/em&gt; Hume continues to
oppose moral rationalism&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; but his arguments against them
appear in an appendix. More importantly, he drops the assumption he
made in the &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt; and takes the selfish theories of Hobbes
and Mandeville as his primary target. Once again, he thinks there are
only two possibilities. Either our approval is based in self-interest
or it has a disinterested basis. The refutation of one is proof of the
other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="MorRatCriPhaTre"&gt;7.1 Moral Rationalism: Critical Phase in the &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume thinks that “systems and hypotheses” have also
“perverted our natural understanding” of morality. The
views of the moral rationalists—Samuel Clarke (1675–1729),
Locke and William Wollaston (1660–1724)—are prominent
among them. One distinctive, but unhealthy, aspect of modern moral
philosophy, Hume believes, is that it allies itself with religion and
thus sees itself as serving the interests of “popular
superstition”. Clarke’s theory and those of the other
rationalists epitomize this tendency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Clarke, Hume’s central rationalist opponent, appeals to reason
to explain almost every aspect of morality. He believes that there are
demonstrable moral relations of fitness and unfitness that we discover
&lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; by means of reason alone. Gratitude, for example, is
a fitting or suitable response to kindness, while ingratitude is an
unfitting or unsuitable response. He believes that the rational
intuition that an action is fitting has the power both to obligate us
and to move us. To act morally is to act rationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume’s most famous and most important objection to moral
rationalism is two-pronged. In &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt; 2.3.3, “Of the
influencing motives of the will”, he rejects the rationalist
ideal of the good person as someone whose passions and actions are
governed by reason. In T 3.1.1, he uses these arguments to show that
moral ideas do not spring from reason alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the first prong of his objection, Hume begins by remarking that
nothing is more common than for philosophers, as well as ordinary
people, to talk about the “combat” between reason and
passion. They say we ought to be governed by reason rather than
passion, and if our passions are not in line with reason’s
commands, we ought to restrain them or bring them into conformity with
reason. Hume counters that “reason alone can never be a motive
to any action of the will” and that by itself it can never
oppose a passion in the direction of the will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
His first argument rests on his empiricist conception of reason. As we
saw in his account of causation, demonstrative reasoning consists in
comparing ideas to find relations among them, while probable reasoning
concerns matters of fact. He considers mathematical reasoning from the
relation of ideas category and causal reasoning from the category of
matters of fact. He asks us to look at instances of actions where
these two types of reasoning are relevant and says that when we do, we
will see that reason alone couldn’t have moved us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No one thinks that mathematical reasoning by itself is capable of
moving us. Suppose you want to stay out of debt. This may move you to
calculate how much money comes in and how much goes out, but
mathematical reasoning by itself does not move us to do anything.
Mathematical reasoning, when it bears on action, is always used in
connection with achieving some purpose and thus in connection with
causal reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume, however, argues that when causal reasoning figures in the
production of action, it always presupposes an existing desire or
want. On his view, reasoning is a process that moves you from one idea
to another. If reasoning is to have motivational force, one of the
ideas must be tied to some desire or affection. As he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It can never in the least concern us to know, that such objects are
causes, and such others effects, if both the causes and effects are
indifferent to us. Where the objects themselves do not affect us,
their connexion can never give them any influence; and ‘tis
plain, that as reason is nothing but the discovery of this connexion,
it cannot be by its means that the objects are able to affect us (T
2.3.3.3/414).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Noticing a causal connection between exercise and losing weight will
not move you to exercise, unless you want to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It immediately follows that reason alone cannot oppose a passion in
the direction of the will. To oppose a passion, reason must be able to
give rise to a motive by itself, since only a motive can oppose
another motive, but he has just shown that reason by itself is unable
to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having exposed reason’s pretensions to rule, Hume inverts the
rationalist’s ideal of the good person, and concludes that
“Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and
can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey
them” (T 2.3.3.4/415).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second prong of Hume’s objection, the argument from
motivation, is directed primarily against Clarke and concerns the
source of our moral concepts: either they spring from reason or from
sentiment. Couching this debate in terms of his own version of the
theory of ideas, he reminds us that to engage in any sort of mental
activity is to have a perception before the mind, so “to approve
of one character, to condemn another, are only so many different
perceptions” (T 3.1.1.2/456). Since there are only two types of
perception—ideas and impressions—the question between
rationalism and sentimentalism is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Whether ’tis by means of our ideas or impressions we
distinguish betwixt vice and virtue, and pronounce an action blameable
or praise-worthy? &lt;/em&gt; (T 3.1.1.3/456)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The argument from motivation has only two premises. The first is that
moral ideas have pervasive practical effects. Experience shows that we
are often motivated to perform an action because we think it is
obligatory or to refrain because we think it is unjust. We try to
cultivate the virtues in ourselves and are proud when we succeed and
ashamed when we fail. If morality did not have these effects on our
passions and actions, moral rules and precepts would be pointless, as
would our efforts to be virtuous. Thus “morals excite passions,
and produce or prevent actions” (T 3.1.1.6/457).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second premise is that by itself reason is incapable of exciting
passions or producing and preventing actions, which Hume supports with
the arguments we just looked at about the influencing motives of the
will. The argument from motivation, then, is that if moral concepts
are capable of exciting passions and producing or preventing actions,
but reason alone is incapable of doing these things, then moral
concepts can’t spring from reason alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reason for Hume is essentially passive and inert: it is incapable by
itself of giving rise to new motives or new ideas. Although he thinks
the argument from motivation is decisive, in T 3.1.1 he offers a
battery of additional arguments, which are intended to show that moral
concepts do not arise from reason alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume takes the defeat of rationalism to entail that moral concepts
spring from sentiment. Of course, he was not the first to claim that
moral ideas arise from sentiment. Hutcheson claimed that we possess,
in addition to our external senses, a special moral sense that
disposes us to respond to benevolence with the distinctive feelings of
approbation. Hume, however, rejects the idea that the moral sentiments
arise from a sense that is an “&lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt; quality”
and part of our “&lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; constitution”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He first argues that there are many different types of virtue, not all
of which are types of benevolence—respecting people’s
property rights, keeping promises, courageousness, and
industriousness—as Hutcheson maintained. If we agree with Hume,
but keep Hutcheson’s idea of a moral sense, we would have to
believe that we have many different “original” senses,
which dispose us to approve of the variety of different virtues
separately. But he complains that this is not only highly implausible,
but also contrary to the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
usual maxims, by which nature is conducted, where a few principles
produce all the variety we observe in the universe. (T 3.1.2.6/473)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Instead of multiplying senses, we should look for a few general
principles to explain our approval of the different virtues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The real problem, however, is that Hutcheson just
claims—hypothesizes—that we possess a unique, original
moral sense. If asked why we have a moral sense, his reply is that God
implanted it in us. Although in his critical phase Hume freely borrows
many of Hutcheson’s arguments to criticize moral rationalism,
his rejection of a God-given moral sense puts him on a radically
different path from Hutcheson in his constructive phase. One way of
understanding Hume’s project is to see it as an attempt to
naturalize Hutcheson’s moral sense theory. He aims to provide a
wholly naturalistic and economical explanation of how we come to
experience the moral sentiments that also explains why we approve of
the different virtues. In the course of explaining the moral
sentiments, Hutcheson’s idea of an original moral sense
disappears from Hume’s account of morality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="SenConPha"&gt;7.2 Sentimentalism: Constructive Phase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt; 3.3.1, Hume turns to his constructive task of
providing a naturalistic explanation of the moral sentiments. He
refers to them as feelings of approval or disapproval, praise or
blame, esteem or contempt. Approval is a kind of pleasant or agreeable
feeling; disapproval a kind of painful or disagreeable feeling. In
several key passages, he describes the moral sentiments as calm forms
of love and hatred. When we evaluate our own character traits, pride
and humility replace love and hatred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume’s project is “to discover the true origin of morals,
and of that love or hatred, which arises” (T 3.3.1/575) when we
contemplate our own or other people’s character traits and
motives. He traces the moral sentiments to &lt;em&gt;sympathy&lt;/em&gt;. Sympathy
is a psychological mechanism that explains how we come to feel what
others are feeling. It is not itself a feeling or sentiment and so
should not be confused with feelings of compassion or pity. Hume
appeals to sympathy to explain a wide range of phenomena: our interest
in history and current affairs, our ability to enjoy literature,
movies, and novels, as well as our sociability. It is central to his
explanations of our passions, our sense of beauty, and our sense of
what is morally good and bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sympathy is a process that moves me from my idea of what someone is
feeling to actually experiencing the feeling. There are four steps to
this process. I first arrive at the idea of what someone is feeling in
any of the usual ways. I next become aware of the
&lt;em&gt;resemblances&lt;/em&gt; between us, so we are linked by that principle
of association. While we resemble every human being to some extent, we
also resemble some individuals more than others—for instance,
those who share our language or culture or are the same age and sex as
we are. The associative principles of &lt;em&gt;contiguity&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;causality&lt;/em&gt; also relate individuals who are located closely to
us in time or space or who are family members or teachers. According
to Hume, we are able to sympathize more easily and strongly with
individuals with whom we have strong associative ties. The stronger
the associative relations, the stronger our sympathetic responses.
Hume then claims—controversially—that we always have a
vivid awareness of ourselves. Finally, he reminds us that the
principles of association not only relate two perceptions, but they
also transmit force and vivacity from one perception to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Suppose my friend recently suffered a devastating loss and I realize
she is feeling sad. The associative principles transmit force and
vivacity from my vivid awareness of myself to my idea of my
friend’s sadness. Since for Hume the difference between
impressions and ideas is that impressions are more lively and
vivacious than ideas, if an idea of a passion is sufficiently
enlivened, it becomes the very passion itself. I now feel sad too, but
not quite as strongly as my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The way Hume uses the idea that the associative principles transmit
force and vivacity in his explanation of sympathy is parallel to the
way he uses it in his explanation of causal inference. In the case of
causal inference, if we have an impression of an effect (smoke), the
associative principles give rise not only to the idea of its cause
(fire), but they also transmit some of the impression’s force
and vivacity to the idea of its cause, so that we come to believe that
fire is the cause of the smoke. A belief is an idea that is so lively
that it is &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; an impression, and influences us in the way
impressions do. Similarly, my lively awareness of myself enlivens by
association my idea of my friend’s sadness. But the result in
the case of sympathy is even stronger: when an idea of a passion is
sufficiently enlivened, it becomes the very passion itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One advantage Hume’s explanation of the moral sentiments in
terms of sympathy has over Hutcheson’s claim that we possess a
God-given moral sense is that it enables him to provide a unified
theory of the mind. He explains the moral sentiments by appealing to
sympathy, which, in turn, he explains in terms of the same associative
principles he invoked to explain causal beliefs. Without sympathy, and
the associative principles that explain it, we would be
unimaginably different than we are—creatures without causal
or moral ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume develops his account of moral evaluation further in response to
two objections to his claim that the moral sentiments arise from
sympathy. The first is the “sympathy is variable”
objection. Sympathy enables us to enter into the feelings of anyone,
even strangers, because we resemble everyone to some extent. But it is
an essential feature of his account of the natural and spontaneous
operation of sympathy that our ability to respond sympathetically to
others varies with variations in the associative relations. I am able
to sympathize more easily and strongly with someone who resembles me
or is related to me by contiguity or causation. The objection is that
the moral sentiments can’t be based in sympathy because the
loves and hatreds that result from the natural and spontaneous
workings of sympathy vary, but our moral approval doesn’t vary.
The second objection is that “virtue in rags” still evokes
our approval. Sympathy works by looking at the actual effects of a
person’s character traits, but sometimes misfortune or lack of
opportunity may prevent an individual from exercising their good
character traits, yet we still admire them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume argues that moral love and hatred spring from sympathy, but only
when we regulate our sympathetic reactions by taking up what he calls
“the general point of view”. There are two regulatory
features to the general point of view. The first is that we survey a
person’s character from the perspective of the person and his
usual associates—friends, family, neighbors, and co-workers. We
sympathize with the person and the people with whom that person
regularly interacts and judge character traits in terms of whether
they are good or bad for these people. Second, we regulate sympathy
further by relying on general rules that specify the general effects
and tendencies of character traits rather than sympathizing with their
actual effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By putting together these two regulatory features, we arrive at
Hume’s idea of the general point of view, which defines a
perspective from which we may survey a person’s character traits
that we share with everyone. When we occupy the general point of view,
we sympathize with the person herself and her usual associates, and
come to admire the person for traits that are normally good for
everyone. The general point of view is, for Hume, the moral
perspective. We do not experience the moral sentiments unless we have
already taken up the general point of view. The moral sentiments and
the concepts to which they give rise are products of taking up that
standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume offers the claim that we admire four sorts of character
traits—those that are useful or immediately agreeable to the
agent or to others—as an empirical hypothesis. While he provides
support for it in his discussion of the individual virtues, he also
uses his fourfold classification to undermine Christian conceptions of
morality. He makes pride a virtue and humility a vice. He throws out
the “monkish” virtues—celibacy, fasting, and
penance—on the grounds that they are not pleasant or useful to
anyone. He also rejects the distinction between virtues and natural
talents, which legislators, “divines” and modern moralists
defend by claiming that the moral virtues are voluntary, whereas
natural talents aren’t. Their goal is to reform us—or at
least our outward behavior—making us better, when understood in
Christian terms. They accordingly restrict the domain of the moral to
actions that proceed from character traits because they believe only
they can be modified, shaped, and controlled by sanctions, while
talents can’t. Hume, however, rejects the distinction along with
the dubious function these reformers assign to morality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume identifies both what has value and what makes things valuable
with features of our psychology. Our first-order sentiments, passions
and affections, as well as actions expressive of them, are what have
moral value. Our second-order reflective sentiments about our own or
other people’s sentiments, passions and affections are what give
them value. On his view, morality is entirely a product of human
nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the “Conclusion” of the second &lt;em&gt;Enquiry&lt;/em&gt;, Hume
summarizes his explanation of morality with a definition of virtue or
merit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
every quality of mind, which is &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;agreeable&lt;/em&gt;
to the &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;himself&lt;/em&gt; or to &lt;em&gt;others&lt;/em&gt;,
communicates a pleasure to the spectator, engages his esteem, and is
admitted under the honourable denomination of virtue or merit. (EPM
9.1.12/277)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a precise parallel of his two definitions of cause in the
first &lt;em&gt;Enquiry.&lt;/em&gt; Both sets of definitions pick out features of
events, and both record a spectator’s response to those
events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="SelIntTheCriPhaEnq"&gt;7.3 Self-Interest Theories: Critical Phase in the &lt;em&gt;Enquiry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume’s second &lt;em&gt;Enquiry&lt;/em&gt; is a sustained and systematic
attack on the “selfish” or “self-love”
theories of Hobbes and Mandeville. He follows Hutcheson in thinking
that they assign two distinct roles to self-interest in their accounts
of morality: first, moral approval and disapproval are based in a
concern for our own interest and, second, the motive of which we
ultimately approve is self-interest. Although many people during this
period understood Hobbes’ theory through Mandeville’s
lens, Hume believes it is important to distinguish them. As he sees
it, Mandeville’s theory is superficial and easily dismissed.
Hobbes is his main opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume’s rejection of Hobbes’ selfish account of approval
and disapproval begins in Section II and ends in Part I of the
“Conclusion” of the &lt;em&gt;Enquiry&lt;/em&gt;. Like Hutcheson, he
mistakenly supposes that Hobbes was offering a rival theory of
approval and disapproval. We approve of people’s character
traits when they benefit us and disapprove of them when they harm us.
Hume looks at each of the four types of virtue and argues that in each
case, our approval does not spring from a concern for our own
happiness, but rather from sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In Section II, Hume argues that one reason we approve of benevolence,
humanity, and public spiritedness is that they are useful to others
and to society. In Sections III and IV, he argues that the sole ground
for approving of justice and political allegiance is that they are
useful to society. In Section V, he asks: But useful for whom? Since
it is obvious that it has to be “for some body’s
interest”, the question is “Whose interest then?” He
assumes there are only two possibilities: approval and disapproval
spring either from sentiments that are interested or from a
disinterested source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
According to Hume, Hobbes’ “deduction of morals from
self-love” begins with our realization that we cannot subsist
alone. A social order provides security, peace, and mutual protection,
conditions that allow us to promote our own interests better than if
we lived alone. Our own good is thus bound up with the maintenance of
society. Although Hume agrees with Hobbes up to this point, he rejects
his explanation that we approve of justice, benevolence, and humanity
because they promote our own happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume is confident that “the voice of nature and
experience” will show that Hobbes’ theory, understood in
this way, is mistaken. Borrowing many of Hutcheson’s arguments,
he points out that if approval and disapproval were based on thoughts
about the possible advantages and disadvantages to us of
people’s characters and actions, we would never feel approval
and disapproval of people from “very distant ages and remote
countries”, since they cannot possibly affect us. We would never
admire the good deeds of our enemies or rivals, since they are hurtful
to us. We would also never approve or disapprove of characters
portrayed in novels or movies, since they are not real people and
cannot possibly help or harm us. We approve of character traits and
actions that are useful not because they benefit us, but because we
sympathize with the benefits they bestow on others or society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume next examines the remaining three types of character
traits—those that are useful to the agent (industriousness, good
judgment), agreeable to the agent (cheerfulness) or agreeable to
others (politeness, decency). Why, for example, do we approve of
industriousness and good judgment, character traits that are primarily
advantageous to the possessor? In most cases they are of absolutely no
benefit to us and, in cases of rivalry, they counteract our own
interest. We approve of these character traits not because they are
beneficial to us, but because we sympathize with the benefits they
confer on others. Hume takes this as further evidence against
Hobbes’ explanation in terms of self-interest and in support of
his sympathy-based account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In Part I of the “Conclusion”, Hume complains that
Hobbes’ self-love theory is unable to explain two important
features of our moral sentiments: we tend to approve of the same sorts
of character traits and we are able to morally evaluate anyone, at any
time or place. If our approval and disapproval were based on thoughts
about our own benefits and harms, the moral sentiments would vary from
person to person and for the same person over time. We wouldn’t
have moral feelings about most people, since most people don’t
affect us. The moral sentiments spring from our capacity to respond
sympathetically to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume is equally adamant that any explanation of the motives that
prompt us to virtuous actions in terms of self-interest is mistaken.
He opposes them in Appendix II of the &lt;em&gt;Enquiry,&lt;/em&gt; which was
originally part of Section II, “Of Benevolence”. He
follows Hutcheson in thinking that the issue is whether the various
benevolent affections are genuine or arise from self-interest. Once
again he distinguishes Mandeville’s from Hobbes’
explanations of benevolence and takes Hobbes to be his main opponent.
On Hume’s reading of Hobbes, while we approve of kindness,
friendship, and other benevolent affections, any desire to benefit
others really derives from self-interest, although we may not always
be conscious of its influence on those desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume offers two arguments against this selfish view. He first asks us
to consider cases in which people are motivated by a genuine concern
for others, even when such concern could not possibly benefit them and
might even harm them. We grieve when a friend dies, even if the friend
needed our help and patronage. How could our grief be based in
self-interest? Parents regularly sacrifice their own interests for the
sake of their children. Non-human animals care about members of their
own species and us. Is their concern a “deduction” of
self-interest? He concludes that these and “a thousand other
instances … are marks of a general benevolence in human nature,
where no interest binds us” (EPM App 2.11/300).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume supplements this argument from experience with a highly
compressed sketch of an argument he borrows from Butler. Happiness
consists in the pleasures that arise from the satisfaction of our
particular appetites and desires. It is because we want food, fame,
and other things that we take pleasure in getting them. If we did not
have any particular appetites or desires, we would not want anything
and there would be nothing from which we would get pleasure. To get
the pleasures that self-love aims at, we must want something other
than happiness itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="JusConPha"&gt;7.4 Justice: Constructive Phase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume rightly showcases his pioneering account of justice. In the
&lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt;, he emphasizes the distinction between the natural
and artificial virtues. The natural virtues—being humane, kind,
and charitable—are character traits and patterns of behavior
that human beings would exhibit in their natural condition, even if
there were no social order. The artificial virtues—respecting
people’s property rights, fidelity in keeping promises and
contracts, and allegiance to government—are dispositions based
on social practices and institutions that arise from conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume believes that nature has supplied us with many
motives—parental love, benevolence, and generosity—that
make it possible for us to live together peacefully in small societies
based on kinship relations. One of his important insights is that
nature has not provided us with all the motives we need to live
together peacefully in large societies. After arguing in
&lt;em&gt;Treatise&lt;/em&gt; 3.2.1 that justice is artificial, in T 3.2.2, he
asks two different questions: What motivates human beings to establish
the rules of justice that give rise to property rights, and why do we
approve of people who obey these rules of justice? The first question
concerns justice as a practice constituted by its rules. The second
concerns justice as a virtue, a person’s disposition to obey the
rules of justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume argues that we enter into a series of conventions to bring about
practices, each of which is a solution to a problem. Each convention
gives rise to new problems that in turn pressure us to enter into
further conventions. The convention to bring about property rights is
only the first of several into which we enter. After property rights
are established, we enter into conventions to transfer property and to
make promises and contracts. According to him, we are by nature
cooperators, although at first we cooperate only with members of our
own family. But it is also advantageous for us to cooperate with
strangers, since it allows us to produce more goods and to exchange
them. All three conventions are prior to the formation of government.
On Hume’s view, it is possible for there to be a peaceful
society of property owners who transfer and exchange material
possessions before there is government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume argues that the practice of justice is a solution to a problem we
naturally face. The problem is that since we care most about our
family and close friends, but material goods are scarce and portable,
we are tempted to take goods from strangers to give to our family and
friends. Disputes over these goods are inevitable, but if we quarrel
we will forfeit the benefits that result from living together in
society—increased power, ability, and security. The solution to
the problem is to establish property rights. We make rules that
specify who has a right to what, and agree to follow the rules and to
keep our hands off the property of others. Hume was one of the
first to see that what is useful is the practice of justice, rather
than individual acts of justice. Like Hobbes, he believes that it is
in our interest to have the practice of justice in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As we just saw, Hume parts company with Hobbes when he answers the
second question about why we approve of people who obey the rules of
justice. If Hobbes’ answer in terms of self-interest is
excluded, he thinks only one possibility remains. We approve of just
people not because they benefit us but because we sympathize with the
benefits they bestow on others and society as a whole. Hume thus
explains our approval of justice by appealing to the same principle he
invoked to explain our approval of the natural virtues. Thus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;em&gt;self-interest is the original motive to the&lt;/em&gt; establishment
&lt;em&gt;of justice: but a sympathy with public interest is the source of
the&lt;/em&gt; moral approbation, &lt;em&gt;which attends that virtue&lt;/em&gt;. (T
3.2.2.24/499–500)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In Part 2 of the “Conclusion” of the &lt;em&gt;Enquiry&lt;/em&gt;,
Hume raises a serious problem with his account of justice. While it is
in our interest to have the practice of justice in place, it may not
always be in our interest to obey its rules in every case. This is the
free rider problem. The free rider, whom Hume calls the sensible
knave, wants to get the benefits that result from having a practice in
place without having to always follow its rules. He knows that the
only way to obtain the advantages of social cooperation is for the
practice of justice to be in place, but he also realizes that a single
act of injustice will not significantly damage the practice. Most people
will obey the rules of justice, so if he commits one act of injustice,
the institution will not be in any danger of collapsing. Suppose he
has the opportunity to commit an act of injustice that will benefit
him greatly. Why shouldn’t he? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume confesses that if the sensible knave expects an answer, he is not
sure there is one that will convince him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If his heart rebel not against such pernicious maxims, if he feel no
reluctance to thoughts of villainy or baseness, he has indeed lost a
considerable motive to virtue…. (EPM 9.2.23/283)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is no general agreement about whether Hume actually provides an
answer to the sensible knave and if he does, whether it is
adequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="PRel"&gt;8. Philosophy of Religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume wrote forcefully and incisively on almost every central question
in the philosophy of religion, contributing to ongoing debates about
the reliability of reports of miracles, the immateriality and
immortality of the soul, the morality of suicide, and the natural
history of religion, among others. All his work excited heated
reactions from his contemporaries, and his arguments still figure
centrally in discussions of these issues today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume’s greatest achievement in the philosophy of religion is the
&lt;em&gt;Dialogues concerning Natural Religion&lt;/em&gt;, which is generally
regarded as one of the most important and influential contributions to
this area of philosophy. While all Hume’s books provoked
controversy, the &lt;em&gt;Dialogues&lt;/em&gt; were thought to be so inflammatory
that his friends persuaded him to withhold them from publication until
after his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hume’s philosophical project, and the method he developed to
execute it, dictates his strategy in all the debates he entered. In
the debates about causation and ethics, there is an initial
&lt;em&gt;critical phase&lt;/em&gt;, where Hume assesses the arguments of his
predecessors and contemporaries, followed by a &lt;em&gt;constructive
phase&lt;/em&gt;, where he develops his own position. In the natural
religion debate, however, the situation is very different.
Hume’s critique of the central concepts of natural religion in
the &lt;em&gt;critical phase&lt;/em&gt; shows that these concepts have no content,
so there is nothing for the &lt;em&gt;constructive phase&lt;/em&gt; of his
argument to be about. Instead of &lt;em&gt;resolving&lt;/em&gt; this debate, Hume
effectively &lt;em&gt;dissolves&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;Dialogues&lt;/em&gt; are a sustained and penetrating critical
examination of a prominent argument from analogy for the existence and
nature of God, the argument from design. The argument from design
attempts to establish that the order we find in the universe is so
like the order we find in the products of human artifice that it too
must be the product of an intelligent designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="Cha"&gt;8.1 The Characters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;Dialogues&lt;/em&gt; record a conversation between three characters.
&lt;em&gt;Cleanthes&lt;/em&gt;, a self–­proclaimed “experimental
theist”, offers the argument from design as an empirical proof
of God’s existence and nature (DCNR 5.2/41). &lt;em&gt;Demea&lt;/em&gt;
opposes him, maintaining that the argument’s merely probable
conclusion demeans God’s mystery and majesty. He believes that
God’s nature is completely inscrutable. Cleanthes dubs Demea a
&lt;em&gt;mystic&lt;/em&gt;, while Demea derides Cleanthes’
&lt;em&gt;anthromorphism&lt;/em&gt;—his human–centered bias in
comparing the creator of the universe to a human mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cleanthes and Demea represent the central positions in the
eighteenth–century natural religion debate. Cleanthes embodies
its dominant, progressive strain, consisting primarily of theologians
in the British Royal Society, who were fascinated by probability and
the previous century’s impressive successes in experimental
natural philosophy. Convinced that the new science gave witness to
God’s providence, they rejected traditional &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;
proofs, which purported to demonstrate God’s existence with
mathematical certainty and without appeal to experience. Instead, they
used the order and regularity they found in the universe to construct
a probabilistic argument for a divine designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Holdouts clung to demonstrative proof in science and theology against
the rising tide of probability. Demea is the champion of these
conservative traditionalists. Since he trots out a lame version of
Samuel Clarke’s cosmological argument in Part 9, some have
thought that Hume models Demea on him. But Demea lacks Clarke’s
rigid rationalism. It is more likely that he epitomizes a group of
minor theologians such as William King, who stressed God’s
incomprehensibility and resorted to &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; arguments only
when they absolutely needed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There was no genuinely sceptical presence in the
eighteenth–century natural religion debate. This makes
&lt;em&gt;Philo&lt;/em&gt;, who both Cleanthes and Demea characterize as a
&lt;em&gt;sceptic&lt;/em&gt;, the ringer in the conversation. Although all three
characters say very Humean things at one time or another,
Philo’s views are consistently the closest to Hume’s.
Philo’s form of scepticism is the &lt;em&gt;mitigated scepticism&lt;/em&gt;
of the first &lt;em&gt;Enquiry&lt;/em&gt;, which makes him the most likely
candidate for Hume’s spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As the &lt;em&gt;Dialogues&lt;/em&gt; begin, all three characters agree that their
subject is God’s &lt;em&gt;nature&lt;/em&gt;, since everyone agrees that he
&lt;em&gt;exists&lt;/em&gt;. Parts 1–8 concern God’s &lt;em&gt;natural
attributes&lt;/em&gt;, his omnipotence, omniscience, and providence, while
Parts 10 and 11 consider his &lt;em&gt;moral attributes&lt;/em&gt;, his
benevolence and righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="GodNatAtt"&gt;8.2 God’s Natural Attributes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Demea holds that God is completely unknown and incomprehensible; all
we can say is that God is a being without restriction, absolutely
infinite and universal. Cleanthes is adamant that the argument from
design establishes all of God’s traditional attributes. Natural
objects and human artifacts resemble one another, so by analogy, their
causes also resemble each other. God is therefore like a human mind,
only very much greater in every respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Demea objects that the argument’s conclusion is only probable,
but Philo responds that the real problem is that the analogy is so
weak. He launches a battery of arguments to show just how weak it is.
The dissimilarities between human artifacts and the universe are more
striking than their similarities. We only experience a tiny part of
the universe for a short time; much of what we do experience is
unknown to us. How can we legitimately infer anything about remote
parts of the universe, much less the universe as a whole?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Philo, however, moves quickly away from chipping at the
argument’s &lt;em&gt;strength&lt;/em&gt; to questioning the intelligibility
of its conclusion. We have no &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; of the origin of a
universe. Since causal inference requires a basis in experienced
constant conjunction between two kinds of things, how can we
legitimately draw any conclusion whatsoever about the origin of the
universe? Does it even require a cause? One or many? Does the cause of
the universe itself require a cause? The problem, then, is not just
that the analogy is weak; the real problem is that it attempts to take
us beyond what we can know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Meanwhile, Demea derides Cleanthes’ &lt;em&gt;anthropomorphism&lt;/em&gt;
while remaining smugly satisfied with what Cleanthes disparagingly
calls his &lt;em&gt;mysticism&lt;/em&gt;. The barbs they throw at each other, and
the speeches Philo goads them to make, help create a dilemma that
Philo uses them to construct. He directs the dilemma at Cleanthes, but
it affects both characters, although Demea is slow to realize this. He
thinks Philo is in league with him in detailing the problems with
Cleanthes’ anthropomorphism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Challenging Cleanthes to explain what he means by God’s mind,
Philo pushes him to admit that he means “a mind like the
human”. Cleanthes, taking the bait, responds, “I know of
no other” (DCNR 5.4/42). He argues that mystics like Demea are
no better than &lt;em&gt;atheists&lt;/em&gt;, since they make God so remote and
incomprehensible that he bears no resemblance to human
characteristics. Philo adds that although we regard God as perfect,
perfection—as we understand it—is relative, not absolute,
so we can’t conclude that we grasp God’s perfections.
Since all God’s attributes involve perfection—perfect
knowledge, perfect power, perfect goodness—we shouldn’t
think that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of his attributes resemble or are even
analogous to ours. But this means that we don’t know what
we’re talking about when we talk about God using the familiar
terms we apply to human minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Demea adds that giving God human characteristics, even if they are
greatly magnified, denies him attributes theists have always ascribed
to him. How can an anthropomorphic God have the &lt;em&gt;unity&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;simplicity,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;immutability&lt;/em&gt; of the God of
traditional theism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Philo continues to detail just how &lt;em&gt;inconvenient&lt;/em&gt;
Cleanthes’ anthropomorphism really is. If he accepts the
argument from design, he must be committed to a God who is finite in
all respects. But what does it mean to say that God is &lt;em&gt;finitely
perfect&lt;/em&gt;? Once you admit that God is finite, you’ve opened a
can of worms, for there are all sorts of equally probable alternatives
to intelligent design. Why think that the universe is more like a
human artifact than an animal or a vegetable? To illustrate, Philo
throws out a number of outlandish alternative hypotheses. For
instance, if you were a spider on a planet of spiders, wouldn’t
you naturally believe that a giant spider spun an immense web to
create the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cleanthes’ design hypothesis is so underdetermined by the
evidence that the only reasonable approach is to abandon any attempt
to adjudicate among it and its many alternatives. Total suspension of
judgment is the only reasonable response. Otherwise, we go beyond the
bounds of anything to which we can give specific content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The dilemma Philo has constructed encapsulates the issue about the
content of the idea of God that is central to the &lt;em&gt;critical
aspect&lt;/em&gt; of Hume’s project in the &lt;em&gt;Dialogues&lt;/em&gt;. If you
accept that God’s attributes are infinitely perfect, you are
using ordinary terms without their ordinary meaning, so that they do
not have any clear meaning. If you deny God’s infinite
perfection, you can give him understandable attributes, but only
because they are amplified human characteristics. The closer Cleanthes
comes to regarding God’s mind as like a human mind, the closer
he comes to regarding God’s attributes as being like human
attributes, and the less Godlike his “God” is. We can only
give the idea of God intelligible content at the perilously high cost
of denying that he is really God. To do so is to abandon God for some
kind of superhero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end of Part 8, which concludes their discussion of God’s
natural attributes, Demea still thinks that Philo and he are partners.
He remains clueless about Philo’s strategy until the very end of
Part 11, when he finally realizes that he too is caught in the trap
Philo has sprung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Demea offers an &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; alternative to the design argument
in Part 9. As noted earlier, it is an abbreviated, watered–down
version of Clarke’s cosmological argument. Although Cleanthes
quickly scotches his lame efforts, Part 9 serves as an interlude
between the previous discussion of God’s &lt;em&gt;natural
attributes&lt;/em&gt; and the consideration of his &lt;em&gt;moral attributes&lt;/em&gt;
in Parts 10 and 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="GodMorAtt"&gt;8.3 God’s Moral Attributes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Demea begins the discussion in Part 10. Attempting to save face from
his recent drubbing, he suggests that we don’t accept the truths
of religion as a result of reasoning, but from what we &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;
when confronted with how helpless and miserable we are. Religion is
based on feelings of fear and anxiety that arise from awareness of our
“imbecility and misery” (DCNR 10.1/68). Our forms of
worship are attempts to appease unknown powers that oppress and
torment us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Philo joins in, claiming he is convinced that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
the best and indeed the only method of bringing everyone to a due
sense of religion is by just representations of the misery and
wickedness of men. (DCNR 10.2/68)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They proceed with a joint litany of the misery and melancholy of the
human condition, topping each other with catalogues of woes. Demea
does not realize that Philo may mean very different things by
“just representation” and “due sense of
religion” than he does, so he fails to realize that Philo is
just egging him on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Philo maintains that we can’t evade the facts of disease,
famine, and pestilence, except by “apologies, which still
farther aggravate the charge” (DCNR 10.16/72). These apologies
are &lt;em&gt;theodicies&lt;/em&gt;—systematic attempts to reconcile
God’s goodness with the existence of evil. Demea is also
scornful of theodicies, blissfully unaware that all too soon he will
be offering his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cleanthes finally breaks in to say that &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t feel
oppressively anxious or miserable, and hopes that anguish isn’t
as common as they claim. But &lt;em&gt;hoping&lt;/em&gt; that the extent of human
misery is not so widespread is not the same as &lt;em&gt;proving&lt;/em&gt; that
it is. Cleanthes is on weak ground. Philo capitalizes on it,
challenging Cleanthes to explain how God’s mercy and benevolence
can possibly resemble human mercy and benevolence. Given God’s
omnipotence, whatever he wills happens, but neither humans nor animals
are happy, so God presumably does not will their happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cleanthes—“smiling”—grants that if Philo can
&lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; that mankind is “unhappy or corrupted”, he
will have succeeded in doing in religion (DCNR 10.28/74). He thinks he
finally has Philo on the ropes. In forcing a sceptic to prove a
positive thesis, he must not only succeed at a difficult task, but
violates his scepticism in the process. Cleanthes fails to realize
that Philo will make his case without needing to prove anything, nor
does he realize that &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; will soon be the one who needs a
proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Demea objects that Cleanthes exaggerates the dire consequences of
acknowledging the human condition, and, despite his earlier vehement
rejection of theodicies, offers his own. Sometimes called “the
porch view”, Demea’s theodicy compares our experience of
the world to the world as a whole, including the afterlife, to trying
to determine the structure of a large building from what little we can
see from its porch. From our perspective, we suffer, but from a longer
view, either we don’t suffer at all, or else our suffering is
for our greater good or for the greater good of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cleanthes retorts that Demea denies the facts, and offers only empty
hypotheses, which, if intelligible at all, could only establish their
bare possibility, but never their reality. The only way to respond to
challenges to God’s benevolence is to deny that the human
condition is really so miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cleanthes has now put himself in the position in which he thought he
had put Philo. He must establish that the facts are as he claims, and
Philo is quick to stress how difficult this will be. By resting his
case on such an uncertain point, any conclusion he draws will be
equally uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Philo then ups the ante by granting for the sake of argument that
human happiness exceeds human misery. But if God is infinitely
powerful, wise, and good, why is there any misery at all? There is no
answer that preserves all God’s attributes, except to grant that
the subject exceeds the limits of our understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Philo, however, refrains from pressing the question of
&lt;em&gt;intelligibility&lt;/em&gt;; he is more interested in building an even
stronger case against Cleanthes’ inference to God’s
&lt;em&gt;benevolence&lt;/em&gt;. Raising the ante higher still, he grants that
pain and suffering are &lt;em&gt;compatible&lt;/em&gt; with God’s infinite
power and goodness. Cleanthes, however, must prove from the
“mixed and confused phenomena” that God’s
benevolence is &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt;, not merely &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;. Doing so
is doubly difficult, since any inference from finite to infinite is
shaky at best, even when the data are “pure and unmixed”
(DCNR 10.35/77).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Philo concludes by admitting, with less than complete sincerity, that
while he was hard pressed to make his case against Cleanthes when the
discussion concerned God’s natural attributes, where his moral
attributes are concerned, he is at ease. He challenges Cleanthes
“to tug the laboring oar” and explain how he can infer
God’s moral attributes from the facts about the human condition
(DCNR 10.36/77).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cleanthes “tugs”, but only for one short paragraph. He
admits that if we go beyond their usual meanings when we apply human
terms to God, what we say is indeed unintelligible. Abandoning all
human analogy is thus to abandon natural religion, but preserving it
makes it impossible to reconcile evil with an infinite God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cleanthes realizes he has painted himself into a corner, but once
again he thinks there is a way out. Abandon God’s infinity;
think of him as “finitely perfect”. Then
“benevolence, regulated by wisdom, and limited by necessity, may
produce just such a world as the present” (DCNR 11.1/78).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cleanthes doesn’t realize that his new theory is worse than his
old one. He also doesn’t seem to remember Philo’s earlier
question about what “finitely perfect” might possibly
mean. Instead of God, he is now committed to some kind of superhero.
Besides, the story he is telling is itself a theodicy. His
superhero’s limitations explain why he cannot eliminate evil, or
create an evil–free world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any case, Cleanthes is no better off than he was before.
Conjectures may show that the data are &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt; with the
idea of God, but are never sufficient to prove that he actually
exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Philo then proceeds to outline four possible hypotheses about the
cause of the universe: it is perfectly good; it is perfectly evil; it
is both good and evil; it is neither good nor evil. Given the evil we
know exists, the data is at best &lt;em&gt;mixed&lt;/em&gt;, so we can’t
establish either of the first two hypotheses. The regularity and
uniformity of the general laws we find in experience is sufficient to
discount the third, so the fourth seems the most probable. On that
hypothesis, the cause of the universe is entirely indifferent to the
amount of good and evil in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These points about &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; evil also apply to &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt;
evil. We have no more reason to think that God’s righteousness
resembles human righteousness than we have to think that his
benevolence resembles human benevolence. We have even less reason, in
fact, since moral evil outweighs moral goodness more than natural evil
outweighs natural goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In addition, Cleanthes’ new form of anthropomorphism is saddled
with tracing moral evil back to God. Since every effect must have a
cause, either the chain of causes goes back infinitely, or it stops
with the original principle that is the ultimate cause of all
things—God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At this point, Demea, who has become increasingly agitated during
Philo’s speech, interrupts. He finally realizes that the case
Philo is making cuts against his own view as much as it cuts against
Cleanthes’. Although it might appear that Demea can retreat to
some form of the theodicy he sketched earlier, the extent to which
Philo’s argument upsets him suggests that he now realizes it is
inadequate. If he leans on the mystery–mongering he has
professed until now, Philo has shown that, because of its lack of
specific content, it does not point exclusively to a good God. It may
just as well commit him to a supreme being who is “beyond good
and evil” and is totally indifferent to morality. Commitment
without content turns out to be no commitment at all. Demea realizes
this, dimly at least, as he leaves the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="ConPar12"&gt;8.4 The Conclusion: Part 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With Demea’s departure, Cleanthes and Philo are left to finish
the conversation. Their tone is conciliatory, so conciliatory that
Philo says he must “confess” that although he is less
cautious about natural religion than any other subject,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
no one has a deeper sense of religion impressed on his mind, or pays
more profound adoration to the divine Being, as he discovers himself
to reason, in the inexplicable contrivance and artifice of nature.
(DCNR 12.2/89)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Philo’s “confession” paves the way for a blockbuster
that has puzzled generations of readers. Philo seems to reverse field,
apparently recanting what he has argued for so forcefully. He grants
Cleanthes that “a purpose, an intention, a design, strikes
everywhere the most careless, the most stupid thinker” (DCNR
12.2/89).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
His remarks are, however, by no means straightforward. Some take
Philo—and, by implication, Hume—to be outing himself as a
closet theist. Others conclude that, since he holds all the cards at
this point, he can afford to be conciliatory. Read ironically, Philo
could be saying that while “careless and stupid” observers
are struck by purpose, intention, and design in the universe, careful,
critical, intelligent ones are not. But there is no need to force the
irony here. Read straight, nature’s “contrivance and
artifice” is “inexplicable” precisely because reason
can discover nothing about God’s natural or moral attributes.
Everyone—even the stupid and careless—can see that the
parts of animals and plants have &lt;em&gt;functions&lt;/em&gt;, and so can easily
understand why “an anatomist, who discovered a new organ or
canal, would never be satisfied until he had also discovered its use
and intention” (DCNR 12.2/90).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Recognizing that an organism’s parts have
&lt;em&gt;uses&lt;/em&gt;—&lt;em&gt;functions&lt;/em&gt;—says nothing about
whether their uses or functions are due to a designer’s plan, so
Philo’s acknowledgement implies nothing about whether he now
accepts the design hypothesis. In fact, what he says here reiterates
his position in Part 8, that function alone is no proof of divine
design:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
it is in vain … to insist on the uses of the parts of animals
or vegetables and their curious adjustment to each other. I would fain
know how an animal could subsist, unless its parts were so adjusted?
(DCNR 8.9/61)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No one should deny design &lt;em&gt;in this sense&lt;/em&gt;, so long as they do
so “without any religious purpose” (DCNR 12.2/90). Far
from reversing himself, then, Philo’s position is continuous
with the line he has taken throughout the &lt;em&gt;Dialogues&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As the conversation continues, Philo provides a diagnosis of the
dispute. While the works of nature do bear “a great
analogy” to the products of human artifice, as its proponents
claim, there are also considerable differences. He suspects that this
may be the source of the intractability of the controversy, which
suggests that it may be at bottom “somewhat of a dispute of
words” (DCNR 12.6/92).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But verbal disputes can be resolved—or
&lt;em&gt;dissolved&lt;/em&gt;—by providing clear definitions. However, the
dilemma about the content of our idea of God that Philo has
constructed clearly implies that such a &lt;em&gt;constructive&lt;/em&gt; solution
is not possible here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Philo explains why only a &lt;em&gt;critical&lt;/em&gt; solution is possible by
offering a deeper diagnosis of the problem. Although the dispute may
appear to be merely verbal, it is in fact “still more incurably
ambiguous”, for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
there is a species of controversy, which, from the very nature of
language and of human ideas, is involved in perpetual ambiguity, and
can never, by any precaution or any definitions, be able to reach a
reasonable certainty or precision. These are the controversies
concerning the degrees of any quality or circumstance. (DCNR
12.7/92)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is exactly what the dispute over intelligent design is about.
Analogies are always matters of degree, and the degrees of the
qualities involved in the design argument aren’t capable of
exact measurement. The controversy thus “admits not of any
precise meaning, nor consequently of any determination” (DCNR
12.7/93). The dispute about design is actually &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; than a
verbal dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That is why anyone, even an atheist, can say, with equal plausibility,
that “the rotting of a turnip, the generation of an animal, and
the structure of human thought” all “probably bear some
remote analogy to each other” (DCNR 12.7/93). That is why Philo,
without renouncing any of his previous claims, can assent to the
“somewhat ambiguous, at least undefined”, and, as we have
seen, &lt;em&gt;indefinable&lt;/em&gt; proposition into which&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
the whole of natural theology … resolves itself …
&lt;em&gt;that the cause or causes of order in the universe probably bear
some remote analogy to human intelligence&lt;/em&gt;. (DCNR 12.33/101)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anything is like anything else in &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; remote respect. So the
ordering principle of the universe, if indeed there is one, can be
&lt;em&gt;absolutely anything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If this is all there is to “the whole of natural
theology”, then we can certainly conclude that the
argument’s conclusion has no religiously significant content.
But it has no religiously significant content because Philo’s
critique has drained it of any content whatsoever. Cleanthes’
design hypothesis is not just false; it is unintelligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The conversation began with all three participants agreeing that their
topic was to discuss only God’s &lt;em&gt;nature&lt;/em&gt;, not his
&lt;em&gt;existence&lt;/em&gt;. As it concludes, it is no longer clear that these
questions are really so distinct as originally assumed. We don’t
know what we’re talking about when we talk about a God whose
nature is inconceivable, incomprehensible, indeterminate, and
indefinable. What, then, are we to make of the claim about his
existence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;Dialogues&lt;/em&gt; draw out the consequences of Hume’s
statement, in the first &lt;em&gt;Enquiry&lt;/em&gt;, that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
the idea of God, as meaning an infinitely intelligent, wise, and good
Being, arises from reflecting on the operations of our own mind, and
augmenting, without limit, those qualities of goodness and wisdom.
(EHU 2.6/19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we insist on “augmenting without limit”, we let loose
the moorings that give intelligible content to God’s
intelligence, wisdom, and goodness. If we stop short of the limit, we
may have content, but we have also lost God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 13:42:40 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">David Hume</guid></item><item><title>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</title><link>https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hegel/</link><description>&lt;div id="main-text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="LifWorInf"&gt;1. Life, Work, and Influence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in 1770 in Stuttgart, Hegel spent the years 1788–1793 as
a student in nearby Tübingen, studying first philosophy, and then
theology, and forming friendships with fellow students, the future
great romantic poet Friedrich Hölderlin (1770–1843) and
Friedrich von Schelling (1775–1854), who, like Hegel, would
become one of the major figures of the German philosophical scene in
the first half of the nineteenth century. These friendships clearly
had a major influence on Hegel’s philosophical development, and
for a while the intellectual lives of the three were closely
intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduation Hegel worked as a tutor for families in Bern and
then Frankfurt, where he was reunited with Hölderlin. Until
around 1800, Hegel devoted himself to developing his ideas on
religious and social themes, and seemed to have envisaged a future for
himself as a type of modernising and reforming educator, in the image
of figures of the German Enlightenment such as Lessing and
Schiller. Around the turn of the century, however, under the influence
of Hölderlin and Schelling, his interests turned more to issues
arising from the critical philosophy initiated by
Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) and developed by J.G. Fichte
(1762–1814). In the 1790s the University of Jena had become a
center for the development of critical philosophy due to the presence
of K.L.  Reinhold (1757–1823) and then Fichte, who taught there
from 1794 until his dismissal on the grounds of atheism at the end of
the decade.  By that time, Schelling, who had first been attracted to
Jena by the presence of Fichte, had become an established figure at
the university.  In 1801 Hegel moved to Jena to join Schelling, and in
same year published his first philosophical work, &lt;em&gt;The Difference
between Fichte’s and Schelling’s System of
Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;, in which he argued that Schelling had succeeded where
Fichte had failed in the project of systematizing and thereby
completing Kant’s transcendental idealism. In 1802 and 1803
Hegel and Schelling worked closely together, editing the &lt;em&gt;Critical
Journal of Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;, and on the basis of this association Hegel
came to be dogged for many years by the reputation of being a
“mere” follower of Schelling (who was five years his
junior).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By late 1806 Hegel had completed his first major work,
the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology of Spirit&lt;/em&gt; (published 1807), which showed a
divergence from his earlier, seemingly more Schellingian, approach.
Schelling, who had left Jena in 1803, interpreted a barbed criticism
in the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt;’s preface as aimed at him, and
their friendship abruptly ended. The occupation of Jena by
Napoleon’s troops as Hegel was completing the manuscript restricted the activities of
the university and Hegel departed. Now without a university
appointment he worked for a short time, apparently very successfully,
as an editor of a newspaper in Bamberg, and then from 1808–1815
as the headmaster and philosophy teacher at a gymnasium (high school)
in Nuremberg. During his time at Nuremberg he married and started a
family, and wrote and published his &lt;em&gt;Science of Logic&lt;/em&gt;. In 1816
he managed to return to his university career by being appointed to a
chair in philosophy at the University of Heidelberg, but shortly
after, in 1818, he was offered and took up the chair of philosophy at
the University of Berlin, the most prestigious position in the German
philosophical world. In 1817, while in Heidelberg he published
the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, a systematic
work in which an abbreviated version of the earlier &lt;em&gt;Science of
Logic&lt;/em&gt; (the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia Logic&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Lesser
Logic&lt;/em&gt;) was followed by the application of its principles to the
philosophy of nature and the philosophy of spirit. In 1821 in Berlin
Hegel published his major work in political philosophy, &lt;em&gt;Elements
of the Philosophy of Right&lt;/em&gt;, based on lectures given at Heidelberg
but ultimately grounded in the section of the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia
Philosophy of Spirit&lt;/em&gt; dealing with &lt;em&gt;objective
spirit&lt;/em&gt;. During the following ten years up to his death in 1831
Hegel enjoyed celebrity at Berlin, and published subsequent versions
of the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia&lt;/em&gt;. After his death versions of his
lectures on philosophy of history, philosophy of religion, aesthetics,
and the history of philosophy were published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Hegel’s death, Schelling, whose reputation had long
since been eclipsed by that of Hegel, was invited to take up the chair
at Berlin, reputedly because the government of the day had wanted to
counter the influence that Hegelian philosophy had exerted on a
generation of students. Since the early period of his collaboration
with Hegel, Schelling had become more religious in his philosophising
and criticised the rationalism of Hegel’s
philosophy. During this time of Schelling’s tenure at Berlin,
important forms of later critical reaction to Hegelian philosophy
developed. Hegel himself had been a supporter of progressive but
non-revolutionary politics, but his followers divided into factions
broadly groupable as those of the left,
right and centre (Toews
1985); from
the &lt;em&gt;left&lt;/em&gt;, Karl Marx was to develop his own purported
scientific approach to society and history which
appropriated many Hegelian ideas into a &lt;em&gt;materialistic&lt;/em&gt;
outlook.  (Later, especially in reaction to orthodox Soviet versions
of Marxism, many so-called Western Marxists re-incorporated
further Hegelian elements back into their forms of Marxist
philosophy.) Many of Schelling’s own criticisms of Hegel’s
rationalism found their way into subsequent
&lt;em&gt;existentialist&lt;/em&gt; thought, especially &lt;em&gt;via&lt;/em&gt; the
writings of Kierkegaard, who had attended Schelling’s
lectures. Furthermore, the interpretation Schelling offered of Hegel
during these years itself helped to shape subsequent
generations’ understanding of Hegel, contributing to the
orthodox or traditional understanding of Hegel as a metaphysical thinker in the pre-Kantian
dogmatic sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In academic philosophy, Hegelian idealism had seemed to collapse
dramatically after 1848 and the failure of the revolutionary movements
of that year, but underwent a revival in both Great Britain and the
United States in the last decades of the nineteenth century. In
Britain, where philosophers such as T.H. Green and F.H. Bradley had
developed metaphysical ideas which they related back to Hegel’s
thought, Hegel came to be one of the main targets of attack by the
founders of the emerging “analytic” movement, Bertrand
Russell and G.E. Moore. For Russell, the revolutionary innovations in
logic starting in the last decades of the nineteenth century with the
work of Frege and Peano had destroyed Hegel’s metaphysics by
overturning the Aristotelian logic on which, so Russell claimed, it
was based, and in line with this dismissal, Hegel came to be seen
within the analytic movement as an historical figure of little genuine
philosophical interest. To some degree, analogous things could be said
of Hegel’s reception from within the twentieth-century
phenomenological tradition that developed in continental Europe, but
although marginalized within such core areas of mainstream academic
philosophy, Hegel nevertheless continued to be a figure of interest
within other philosophical movements such as existentialism and
Marxism. In France, a version of Hegelianism came to influence a
generation of thinkers, including Jean Hyppolite, Jean-Paul Sartre and
the psychoanalyst, Jacques Lacan, largely through the lectures of
Alexandre Kojève. However, a later generation of French
philosophers coming to prominence in the 1960s tended to react against
Hegel in ways analogous to those in which early analytic philosophers
had reacted against the Hegel who had influenced their
predecessors. In Germany, having lapsed in the second half of the
nineteenth century, interest in Hegel was revived at the turn of the
twentieth with the historical work of Wilhelm Dilthey, and important
Hegelian elements were incorporated within the approaches of thinkers
of the Frankfurt School, such as Theodor Adorno, and later,
Jürgen Habermas, as well as within the Heidegger-influenced
&lt;em&gt;hermeneutic&lt;/em&gt; approach of H.-G. Gadamer. In Hungary,
similar Hegelian themes were developed by Georg Lukács and
later thinkers of the Budapest School. In the 1960s the
German philosopher Klaus Hartmann developed what was termed a
&lt;em&gt;non-metaphysical&lt;/em&gt; interpretation of Hegel which, together
with the work of Dieter Henrich and others, played an important role
in the revival of interest in Hegel in academic philosophy in the
second half of the century. Within English-speaking philosophy, the
final quarter of the twentieth century saw something of a revival of
serious interest in Hegel’s philosophy with important works
appearing such as those by H.S. Harris, Charles Taylor, Robert Pippin
and Terry Pinkard in North America, and Stephen Houlgate and Robert
Stern in Great Britain. By the close of the twentieth century, even
within core logico-metaphysical areas of analytic philosophy, a number
of individuals such as Robert Brandom and John McDowell had started to
take Hegel seriously as a significant modern philosopher, although
generally within analytic circles a favorable reassessment of Hegel
has still a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="Heg"&gt;2. Hegel’s Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hegel’s own pithy account of the nature of philosophy given
in the &lt;em&gt;Preface&lt;/em&gt; to his &lt;em&gt;Elements of the Philosophy of
Right&lt;/em&gt; captures a characteristic tension in his philosophical
approach and, in particular, in his approach to the nature and limits
of human cognition. “Philosophy”, he says there, “is
its own time comprehended in thoughts” (PR: 21).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand we can clearly see in the phrase “its own
time” the suggestion of an historical or cultural
conditionedness and variability which applies even to the highest form
of human cognition, philosophy itself. The contents of philosophical
knowledge, we might suspect, will come from the historically changing
contents of its cultural context. On the other, there is the hint of
such contents being raised to some higher level,
presumably higher than other levels of cognitive functioning such as
those based in everyday perceptual experience, for example, or those
characteristic of other areas of culture such as art and
religion. This higher level takes the form of conceptually articulated
&lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt;, a type of cognition commonly taken as capable of
having purportedly eternal contents (think of Plato and Frege, for
example, who both have the truths of mathematics in mind). In line
with such a conception, Hegel sometimes referred to the task of
philosophy as that of recognising &lt;em&gt;the concept&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Der
Begriff&lt;/em&gt;) in the mere representations (&lt;em&gt;Vorstellungen&lt;/em&gt;) of
everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This antithetical combination within human cognition of the
temporally-conditioned and the eternal, a combination which reflects a
broader conception of the human being as what Hegel describes
elsewhere as a “finite-infinite”, (SL: 114) has led to
Hegel being regarded in different ways by different types of
philosophical readers.  For example, an historically-minded pragmatist
like Richard Rorty, distrustful of all claims or aspirations to the
so-called God’s-eye view, could praise Hegel as a
philosopher who had introduced this historically reflective dimension
into philosophy (and set it on the characteristically
romantic path which has predominated in modern
continental philosophy) but who had unfortunately still remained
bogged down in the remnants of the Platonistic idea of the search for
ahistorical truths (Rorty 1982).  Those adopting such an approach to
Hegel tend to have in mind the (relatively) young author of
the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology of Spirit&lt;/em&gt; and have tended to dismiss as
“metaphysical” later and more systematic works like
the &lt;em&gt;Science of Logic&lt;/em&gt;. In contrast, the British Hegelian
movement at the end of the nineteenth century tended to ignore
the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt; and the more historicist dimensions of his
thought, and found in Hegel a systematic metaphysician
whose &lt;em&gt;Logic&lt;/em&gt; provided the basis for a definitive philosophical
ontology. This latter traditional &lt;em&gt;metaphysical&lt;/em&gt; view of
Hegel dominated Hegel reception for most of the twentieth century, but
from the 1980s came to be challenged by scholars who offered an
alternative non-metaphysical, post-Kantian
view. By “non-metaphysical” these thinkers had in
mind metaphysics in the sense that Kant had been critical of, a point
sometimes missed by critics. But in turn, this post-Kantian reading
has been challenged by a &lt;em&gt;revised metaphysical&lt;/em&gt; view, critical
of the purported &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt;-assimilation of Hegel to Kant by the
post-Kantians. In the revised metaphysical view, appeal is often made
to Aristotelian or Spinozist conceptual realist features of
Hegel’s thought, as well as to features of recent analytic
metaphysics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before surveying these competing views, however, something needs to
be said about the confusing term “idealism”, and about the
variety of idealism that is characteristic of Hegel and other German
idealists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="BacIdeUndGerTra"&gt;2.1 Background: Idealism as understood in the German tradition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Idealism” is a term that had been used sporadically by
Leibniz and his followers to refer to a type of philosophy that was
opposed to &lt;em&gt;materialism&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, for example, Leibniz had
contrasted &lt;em&gt;Plato&lt;/em&gt; as an idealist with &lt;em&gt;Epicurus&lt;/em&gt; as a
materialist. The opposition to materialism here, together with the
fact that in the English-speaking world the Irish philosopher and
clergyman George Berkeley (1685–1753) is often taken as a
prototypical idealist, has given rise to the assumption that idealism
is necessarily an immaterialist doctrine. This
assumption, however, is mistaken. With the possible exception of
Leibniz, the idealism of the Germans was not committed to the type of
doctrine found in Berkeley according to which immaterial minds, both
infinite (God’s) and finite (those of humans), were the
ultimately real entities, with &lt;em&gt;apparently&lt;/em&gt; material things to
be understood as reducible to &lt;em&gt;states&lt;/em&gt; of such minds—that
is, to ideas in the sense meant by the British
empiricists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Leibniz’s use of Plato to exemplify idealism suggests,
idealists in the German tradition tended to hold to the reality or
objectivity of ideas in the Platonic sense, and for Plato, it would
seem, such ideas were not conceived as &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; any mind at
all—not even the mind of Plato’s &lt;em&gt;god&lt;/em&gt;. The type of
picture found in Berkeley was only to be found in certain late antique
Platonists and, especially, early Christian Platonists like Saint
Augustine, Bishop of Hippo. But especially for the German idealists
like Hegel, Plato’s philosophy was understood through the lenses
of more Aristotelian varieties of neo-Platonism, which pictured the
thoughts of a divine mind as immanent in
matter, and not as contained in some purely immaterial or spiritual
mind. It thus had features closer to the more pantheistic picture of
divine thought found in Spinoza, for example, for whom matter and mind
were attributes of the one substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even for Leibniz, whose later monadological metaphysics was perhaps
closer to Berkeley’s immaterialist philosophy, an opposition to
materialism didn’t necessarily imply immaterialism. Leibniz had
resisted Descartes’ postulation of distinct spiritual and
material substances, treating corporeal bodies as inseparable
combinations of form and matter after the manner of Aristotle. The
materialists to which he was opposed (mechanistic corpuscularists of
his time) conceived of unformed matter as a type of self-subsistent
substance, and it seems to have been &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; conception to which
he was opposed, at least in some periods of his work, not the reality
of matter &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;. Leibniz’s combination of Platonic and
Aristotelian notions played a role in the thought of the later
idealists, giving their opposition to materialism its distinctive
character. These anti-immaterialist features of the idealism of the
Germans became more prominent in the post-Kantian period as they moved
progressively away from the more subjectivistic features of
Leibniz’s thought (Beiser 2002).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="TraMetVieHeg"&gt;2.2 The &lt;em&gt;traditional&lt;/em&gt; metaphysical view of Hegel’s philosophy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the understanding of Hegel that predominated at the time of
the birth of analytic philosophy, together with the fact that early
analytic philosophers were rebelling precisely against
Hegelianism so understood, the interpretation of Hegel
encountered in discussions within analytic philosophy is often that of
the late nineteenth-century interpretation. In this picture, Hegel is
seen as offering a metaphysico-religious view of God &lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt;
Absolute Spirit, as the ultimate reality that we can
come to know through pure thought processes alone. In short,
Hegel’s philosophy is treated as exemplifying the type of
pre-critical or &lt;em&gt;dogmatic&lt;/em&gt; metaphysics against which Kant
had reacted in his &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt;, and as a return
to a more religiously driven conception of philosophy to which Kant
had been opposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much that can be found in Hegel’s writings that
seems to support this view. In his lectures during his Berlin period
one comes across claims such as the one that philosophy “has no
other object but God and so is essentially rational theology”
(Aes I: 101). Indeed, Hegel often seems to invoke imagery consistent
with the types of neo-Platonic conceptions of the universe that had
been common within Christian mysticism, especially in the German
states, in the early modern period. The peculiarity of Hegel’s
form of idealism, on this account, lies in his idea that the mind of
God becomes actual only via its particularization in the minds of
“his” finite material creatures. Thus, in our
consciousness of God, we somehow serve to realize his &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt;
self-consciousness, and, thereby, his own perfection. In
English-language interpretations, such a picture is effectively found
in the work of Charles Taylor (1975) and Michael Rosen
(1984), for example. With
its dark mystical roots, and its overtly religious content, it is
hardly surprising that the philosophy of Hegel so understood has
rarely been regarded as a live option within the largely
secular and scientific conceptions of philosophy that
have been dominant in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important consequence of Hegel’s metaphysics, so
understood, concerns history and the idea of historical development or
progress, and it is as an advocate of an idea concerning the
logically-necessitated teleological course of history that Hegel is
most often derided. To critics, such as Karl Popper in his popular
post-war &lt;em&gt;The Open Society and its
Enemies&lt;/em&gt; (1945), Hegel had not only advocated a disastrous political
conception of the state and the relation of its citizens to it, a
conception prefiguring twentieth-century totalitarianism, but he had
also tried to underpin such advocacy with dubious
theo-logico-metaphysical speculations. With his idea of the
development of &lt;em&gt;spirit&lt;/em&gt; in history, Hegel is seen as
literalising a way of talking about different cultures in terms of
their spirits, of constructing a developmental sequence
of epochs typical of nineteenth-century ideas of linear historical
progress, and then enveloping this story of human progress in terms of
one about the developing self-conscious of the cosmos-God itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the bottom line of such an account concerned the evolution of
states of a mind (God’s), such an account is clearly an idealist
one, but not in the sense, say, of Berkeley. The pantheistic legacy
inherited by Hegel meant that he had no problem in considering an
objective &lt;em&gt;outer&lt;/em&gt; world beyond any particular subjective mind.
But this objective world itself had to be understood as conceptually
informed: it was &lt;em&gt;objectified&lt;/em&gt; spirit. Thus in contrast to
Berkeleian &lt;em&gt;subjective&lt;/em&gt; idealism it became common to talk
of Hegel as incorporating the &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt; idealism of
views, especially common among German historians, in which social life
and thought were understood in terms of the conceptual or
spiritual structures that informed them. But in contrast
to both forms of idealism, Hegel, according to this reading,
postulated a form of &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt; idealism by including both
subjective life and the objective cultural practices on which
subjective life depended within the dynamics of the development of the
self-consciousness and self-actualisation of God, the &lt;em&gt;Absolute&lt;/em&gt;
Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this seemingly dominant theological theme, Hegel was still
seen by many as an important precursor of other more
characteristically secular strands of modern thought such as
existentialism and Marxist materialism. Existentialists were thought
of as taking the idea of the finitude and historical and cultural
dependence of individual subjects from Hegel, and as leaving out all
pretensions to the Absolute, while Marxists were thought
of as taking the historical dynamics of the Hegelian picture but
reinterpreting this in materialist rather than idealist categories. As
for understanding Hegel himself, the traditional metaphysical view
remained the dominant interpretative approach of Hegel scholars
throughout much of the twentieth century. In the last quarter of the
century, however, it came to be vigorously questioned, with a variety
of interpreters putting forward very different accounts of the basic
nature of Hegel’s philosophical project. While a number of
interpretations of Hegel have emerged during this period in an effort
to acquit him of implausible metaphysico-theological views, one
prominent tendency has been to stress the continuity of his ideas with
the “critical philosophy” of Immanuel Kant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="PosKanSomCalNonMetVieHeg"&gt;2.3 The post-Kantian (sometimes called the non-metaphysical) view of Hegel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Least controversially, it is often claimed that either
particular &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;, such as the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology of
Spirit&lt;/em&gt;, or particular &lt;em&gt;areas&lt;/em&gt; of Hegel’s philosophy,
especially his ethical and political philosophy, can be understood as
standing independently of the type of unacceptable metaphysical system
sketched above. Thus it is commonly asserted that implicit within the
metaphysical Hegel is an anti-metaphysical philosopher struggling to
get out—one potentially capable of beating the critical Kant at
his own game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More controversially, one now finds it argued that the traditional
picture is simply wrong at a more general level, and that Hegel, even
in his systematic thought, was not committed to the bizarre,
teleological &lt;em&gt;spirit monism&lt;/em&gt; that has been traditionally
attributed to him because he was free of the type of traditional
metaphysical commitments that had been criticized by Kant. Prominent
among such interpretations has been the so-called
post-Kantian interpretation advanced by North American
Hegel scholars Robert Pippin (1989, 2008, 2019) and Terry Pinkard
(1994, 2000, 2012). From an explicitly analytic perspective, broadly
similar views have been put forward by Robert Brandom (2002, 2014,
2019) and John McDowell (2006, 2018). Thus while the traditional view sees
Hegel as exemplifying the very type of metaphysical speculation that
Kant successfully criticised, the post-Kantian view regards him as
both accepting and &lt;em&gt;extending&lt;/em&gt; Kant’s critique,
ultimately turning it against the residual dogmatically
metaphysical aspects of Kant’s own philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hegel, the non-traditionalists argue, one can see the ambition
to bring together the universalist dimensions of Kant’s
transcendental program with the culturally contextualist conceptions
of his more historically and relativistically-minded contemporaries,
resulting in his controversial conception of spirit, as
developed in his &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology of Spirit&lt;/em&gt;. With this notion,
it is claimed, Hegel was essentially attempting to answer the Kantian
question of the conditions of rational human mindedness,
rather than being concerned with giving an account of the developing
self-consciousness of God. But while Kant had limited such conditions
to formal abstractly conceived structures of the mind,
Hegel extended them to include aspects of historically and socially
determined forms of embodied human existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="RevMetVieHeg"&gt;2.4 The &lt;em&gt;revised&lt;/em&gt; metaphysical view of Hegel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the strong post-Kantian interpretation of Hegel
has been resisted by defenders of the more traditional approach, who
have argued against the plausibility of attempting to rehabilitate
Hegel’s philosophy by divesting it of any purportedly
unacceptable metaphysical claims (see, for example, Beiser 2005 and
Horstmann 2006).  Proponents of the post-Kantian view, it is commonly
said, are guilty of projecting onto Hegel views they
would &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to find there rather than what is actually to be
found. However, the strong post-Kantian interpretation
has &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; been challenged by a somewhat different version of
the metaphysical reading by interpreters who, while recognizing the
influence of Kant’s critical philosophy of Hegel, emphasize
Hegel’s critique of Kant and affirm the irreducible role played
by a form of metaphysics in Hegel’s philosophy.  Nevertheless,
they share the post-Kantians’ attempts to separate Hegel’s
views from the extravagant views traditionally ascribed
to him and generally argue for the broad acceptability of
Hegel’s views from the perspective of the present. Here one
tends to find interpreters attributing to Hegel some type of
conceptual realism, sometimes appealing to
contemporary &lt;em&gt;analytic&lt;/em&gt; metaphysics for the legitimacy of
metaphysics conceived as inquiry into the fundamental
features or structures of the world
itself. Among the interpreters advancing something like this
&lt;em&gt;revised&lt;/em&gt; metaphysical view might be counted Stephen
Houlgate (2005b), Robert
Stern (2002, 2009), Kenneth Westphal
(2003), James Kreines
(2006, 2008) and Christopher Yeomans (2012).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a number of points, the proponents of the revised conceptual
realist metaphysical interpretation will agree with advocates of the
post-Kantian non-metaphysical approach. First, they tend
to agree in dismissing much of the extravagant
metaphysics traditionally ascribed to Hegel. Generally they
don’t find in Hegel the type of classical teleological spirit
monism central to, say, Taylor’s interpretation. Next, they
stress the importance for Hegel of Kant’s critique of
metaphysics. Both think that Hegel took Kant’s critique
seriously, and in turn subjected that critique itself to a
telling &lt;em&gt;meta-critique&lt;/em&gt;, showing that Kant himself was not free
from the sorts of ungrounded metaphysical assumptions he criticized in
others. However, while the post-Kantians interpret Hegel’s
criticisms of Kant as suggesting that Hegel thereby realized or
completed Kant’s critical intention, creating a
form of philosophizing purged of metaphysics, proponents of the
revised metaphysical interpretation typically see his criticism of
Kant as involving a rejection of Kant’s anti-metaphysical
attitude, and as reestablishing, on a new basis, a metaphysical
program originally derived from Aristotle (e.g., Stern) or Spinoza
(e.g., Houlgate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is for the most part clear what sets both post-Kantians
and conceptual realists against the traditional view, it is still not
clear which issues dividing them are substantive and which are
ultimately verbal. Brandom, for example, while often classed with the
post-Kantians, also construes Hegel as a conceptual realist (Brandom
2019), while Redding, appealing to the earlier work of J. N. Findlay,
attempts to combine the post-Kantian approach with what he calls
an &lt;em&gt;actualist&lt;/em&gt; rather than a realist interpretation of Hegel
(Redding 2017). In recent work, both Pippin (2019) and Pinkard (2014),
the major representatives of the post-Kantian position, have insisted
that their own interpretations are compatible with many of the
Aristotelian features of Hegel to which conceptual realists allude.

&lt;p&gt;In relation to such debates it must be remembered that Kant himself
was not critical of metaphysics &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;. His claim was that
existing (so-called dogmatic) metaphysics was in a state analogous to
that in which, say, physics had been in before the scientific
revolution of sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Rather than wanting
to eliminate metaphysics, after the style, say, of Hume or the modern
logical positivists, Kant had wanted to put metaphysics itself on a
secure scientific basis analogous to what Galileo and Newton had
achieved for physics. Thus the very idea of an
&lt;em&gt;Hegelian metaphysics&lt;/em&gt; is in no way straightforwardly
incompatible with the project of a post-Kantian
completion of Kant’s critical program. 

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="HegPubWor"&gt;3. Hegel’s Published Works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may think of there being five different types of work that make
up Hegel’s published corpus. First, there are Hegel’s two
major stand-alone books written for publication already
mentioned—&lt;em&gt;Phenomenology of Spirit&lt;/em&gt; (1807)
and &lt;em&gt;Science of Logic&lt;/em&gt; (1812–18). In the next category
are works that were published at the time as &lt;em&gt;handbooks&lt;/em&gt; for
use in student teaching such as the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia of Philosophical
Sciences&lt;/em&gt; first published in 1817 while he was teaching at
Heidelberg and subsequently revised and republished in 1827 and again
in 1830, and &lt;em&gt;Elements of the Philosophy of Right&lt;/em&gt;, effectively
an expansion of a section of the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia&lt;/em&gt; and published
in 1820 after his move to Berlin. (Transcripts of his earlier lectures
on this topic delivered in Heidelberg have also since been published.)
Along with the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of
Right&lt;/em&gt; might be added similar teaching-related writings from the
Jena period, prepared as lectures but only published as such much
later. The third major category is formed by posthumously published
lecture courses from his time at the University of Berlin, which,
after Hegel’s death, were assembled by editors from his lecture
notes and from student transcripts of the lectures as
delivered—these include his lectures on the &lt;em&gt;Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;
of &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of Spirit, Philosophy of
History&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Aesthetics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of Religion&lt;/em&gt;,
and &lt;em&gt;History of Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;.  Next might be considered various
miscellaneous essays and short works published during his career, and
finally we can count Hegel’s early works, written in the period
between his student years at Tübingen and his move to Jena, and
predominantly on religious and political themes
(ETW). Here we will restrict the discussion to the first three
categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="Boo"&gt;3.1 Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="PheSpi"&gt;3.1.1 &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology of Spirit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term “phenomenology” had been coined by the Swiss
mathematician (and Kant correspondent) J.H. Lambert (1728–1777)
in his &lt;em&gt;The New Organon&lt;/em&gt; of 1764, and in a letter to Lambert,
sent to accompany a copy of his Inaugural Dissertation
(1770), Kant had proposed his own project of a “general
phenomenology” as a necessary propaedeutic
presupposed by the science of metaphysics. Such a phenomenology was
meant to determine the “validity and limitations” of what
he called the “principles of sensibility”, principles he
had (he thought) shown in the accompanying work to be importantly
different to those of conceptual thought. The term clearly suited Kant
as he had distinguished the phenomena known through the
faculty of sensibility from the noumena known purely
conceptually. This envisioned phenomenology seems to coincide roughly
with what he was to eventually describe as a &lt;em&gt;critique of pure
reason&lt;/em&gt;, although Kant’s thought had gone through
important changes by the time that he came to publish the work of that
name (1781, second edition 1787). Perhaps because of this he never
again used the term “phenomenology” for quite this
purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is clearly some continuity between Kant’s notion and
Hegel’s project. In a sense Hegel’s phenomenology is a
study of &lt;em&gt;phenomena&lt;/em&gt; (although this is not a realm he
would contrast with that of noumena) and
Hegel’s &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology of Spirit&lt;/em&gt; is likewise to be
regarded as a type of propaedeutic to philosophy rather
than an exercise &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; or work &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; philosophy. It is
meant to function as an induction or education of the reader to
the &lt;em&gt;standpoint&lt;/em&gt; of purely conceptual thought from which
philosophy can be done. As such, its structure has been compared to
that of a &lt;em&gt;Bildungsroman&lt;/em&gt; (educational novel), having an
abstractly conceived protagonist—the bearer of an evolving
series of so-called shapes of consciousness or the inhabitant of a
series of successive phenomenal worlds—whose progress and
set-backs the reader follows and learns from. Or at least this is how
the work sets out: in the later sections the earlier series of
shapes of consciousness becomes replaced with what seem
more like configurations of human &lt;em&gt;social life&lt;/em&gt;, and the work
comes to look more like an account of interlinked forms of social
existence and thought within which participants in such forms of
social life conceive of themselves and the world. Hegel constructs a
series of such shapes that maps onto the history of western European
civilization from the Greeks to his own time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that this progression ends in the attainment of what Hegel
refers to as Absolute Knowing, the standpoint from which
real philosophy gets done, seems to support the traditionalist reading
in which a triumphalist narrative of the growth of western
civilization is combined with the theological interpretation of
God’s self-manifestation and self-comprehension. When Kant had
broached the idea of a phenomenological propaedeutic to Lambert, he
himself had still believed in the project of a purely conceptual
metaphysics achievable by the use of the regressive or
&lt;em&gt;analytic&lt;/em&gt; method, but this project conceived as an
exercise in theoretical reason was just what Kant in his later
critical philosophy had come to disavow. Traditional readers of Hegel
thus see the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;em&gt;telos&lt;/em&gt; as
attesting to Hegel’s pre-Kantian (that is, pre-critical)
outlook, and his embrace of the metaphysical project that Kant
famously came to dismiss as illusory.  Supporters of
the &lt;em&gt;post-Kantian&lt;/em&gt; interpretation of Hegel obviously interpret
this work and its &lt;em&gt;telos&lt;/em&gt; differently. For example, it has been
argued (e.g., Pinkard 1994) that what this history tracks is the
development of a type of social existence which enables a unique form
of rationality, in that in such a society all dogmatic bases of
thought have been gradually replaced by a system in which all claims
become open to rational self-correction, by becoming exposed to
demands for conceptually-articulated justifications. As Pinkard had
pointed out in that work, this was a conception of the normatively
structured practices of human reason found in the American pragmatist
Wilfrid Sellars, the inspiration behind the Hegelian dimensions of
analytic philosophers such as Willem deVries (1988), Robert Brandom
and John McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something of Hegel’s phenomenological method may be conveyed
by the first few chapters, which are perhaps among its more
conventionally philosophical parts (Westphal 2009). Chapters 1 to 3
effectively follow a developmental series of distinct shapes of
consciousness—jointly epistemological and ontological
attitudes articulated by criteria which are, regarded from one
direction, criteria for certain &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt;, and from the
other, criteria for the nature of the &lt;em&gt;objects&lt;/em&gt; of such
knowledge. In chapter 1, the attitude of &lt;em&gt;Sense-certainty&lt;/em&gt;
takes immediately given perceptual simples—the sort of role
played by the so-called sense-data of early
twentieth-century analytic epistemology, for example, with which a
subject is purportedly acquainted as &lt;em&gt;bare thises&lt;/em&gt;—as the
fundamental objects known. By following this form of
consciousness’s attempts to make these implicit
criteria &lt;em&gt;explicit&lt;/em&gt;, we are meant to appreciate that any such
contents, even the apparently most immediate ones, are
in fact grasped &lt;em&gt;conceptually&lt;/em&gt;, and so, in Hegel’s
terminology, their reception is actually mediated by the
concepts with which they are grasped. Hegel is clear that these
contents are not merely qualitative simples that are
immediately &lt;em&gt;apprehended&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;comprehended&lt;/em&gt; instances
of the conceptual determination of singularity
[&lt;em&gt;Einzelheit&lt;/em&gt;] (Phen: §91). Such a simple
&lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;, then, can also be understood as an instance of
what the Medievals discussed as &lt;em&gt;thisness&lt;/em&gt;—a
general &lt;em&gt;property&lt;/em&gt; of an individual thing’s being
identical to itself. One might compare Hegel’s point here to
that expressed by Kant in his well known claim from &lt;em&gt;Critique of
Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt; (A51/B75), that &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; general
concepts, &lt;em&gt;intuitions&lt;/em&gt; (singular [&lt;em&gt;einzeln&lt;/em&gt;] purportedly
immediate mental representations), are &lt;em&gt;blind&lt;/em&gt;. However,
Hegel seems to want to make this point &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; relying on
Kant’s formal distinction &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; concepts and
intuitions as different species of representation. The idea seems to
be that for Hegel, &lt;em&gt;the same content&lt;/em&gt; can play the roles played
by both concepts and intuitions in Kant. (The lessons of this chapter
have sometimes been likened to those of Wilfrid Sellars’s famous
criticism of the empiricist &lt;em&gt;myth of the given&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this chapter our protagonist consciousness (and by
implication, we the audience to this drama) has learnt that the nature
of consciousness cannot be as originally thought: rather than being
immediate and singular, its contents must have some implicit universal
(conceptual) aspect to them. The general &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; that was
learned about the apparent qualitative simples in Sense-certainty
(that they were instances of generals) is now explicitly taken as
the &lt;em&gt;truth of the object&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Perception&lt;/em&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;Wahrnehmung&lt;/em&gt;—in German this term having the
connotations of taking (&lt;em&gt;nehmen&lt;/em&gt;) to be true
(&lt;em&gt;wahr&lt;/em&gt;)). In contrast to the purported single object of
Sense-certainty the object of Perception is taken &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt;
instantiating general properties: it is “a thing with many
properties” (Phen: §112). But this can be conceived in a
variety of ways: first, as a simple &lt;em&gt;bundle&lt;/em&gt; of indifferent
qualities (a picture associated with Plato), or as an underlying
substrate &lt;em&gt;in which&lt;/em&gt; these qualities somehow inhere (a picture
associated with Aristotle). Predictably, problems will be revealed in
these various different ways of thinking of the nature of those
everyday objects of our experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the case of Sense-certainty, here in the case of Perception,
by following the protagonist consciousness’s efforts to make
this implicit criterion explicit, we see how the criterion generates
contradictions that eventually undermine it &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; a criterion
for certainty. In fact, such collapse into a type of self-generated
skepticism is typical of all the shapes we follow in the
work, and there seems something inherently skeptical about such
reflexive cognitive processes. But this is not the type of skepticism
that is typical of early modern philosophy, such as that used by
Descartes in his attempt to find some foundation
of &lt;em&gt;indubitability&lt;/em&gt; on which genuine knowledge can be built
(Forster 1989). As is clear from his treatment of ancient philosophy
in the &lt;em&gt;Lectures on the History of Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;, Hegel was
attracted to the type of &lt;em&gt;dialectic&lt;/em&gt; employed by Socrates in
his efforts to get his interlocutors thinking about something beyond
that given immediately in sensation (LHP II: 51), and implicit in the
ancient form of skepticism that had been employed after Socrates (LHP
II: 344). For Hegel, the ancient skeptics captured the skeptical
moment of thought that is the means by which thought
progresses &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; the particular categories that have given
rise to contradictions. Just as in the way a new shape of
thought, Perception, had been generated from the internal
contradictions that emerged within Sense-certainty, the
collapse of any given attitude will be accompanied by the emergence of
some new implicit criterion that will be the basis of a new emergent
attitude. In the case of Perception, the emergent new shape of
consciousness, the Understanding, explored in Chapter 3,
is a shape identified with the type of scientific cognition that,
rather than remaining on the level of the perceived object, posits
underlying &lt;em&gt;forces&lt;/em&gt; involved in the production of the
perceptual episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition from Chapter 3 to Chapter 4, The Truth of
Self-Certainty, also marks a more general transition from
Consciousness to &lt;em&gt;Self&lt;/em&gt;-consciousness. It is in the course of
Chapter 4 that we find what is perhaps the most well-known part of
the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt;, the account of the &lt;em&gt;struggle of
recognition&lt;/em&gt; in which Hegel examines the inter-subjective
conditions which he sees as necessary for any form of consciousness.
This is a topic that had first been taken up by Alexandre
Kojève (1969), and which has been appealed to in
non-Kojèvean ways recently by a number of non-traditional
interpreters in order to give a quite different accounts of
Hegel’s notion of &lt;em&gt;Spirit&lt;/em&gt; (Honneth 1995; Ikäheimo
and Laitinen 2011; Pippin 2008; Williams
1992, 1997).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Kant, Hegel thinks that one’s capacity to
be &lt;em&gt;conscious&lt;/em&gt; of some external object as something distinct
from oneself requires the reflexivity of &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt;-consciousness,
that is, it requires one’s awareness &lt;em&gt;of oneself&lt;/em&gt; as a
subject &lt;em&gt;for whom&lt;/em&gt; something distinct, the object, is
presented &lt;em&gt;as known&lt;/em&gt; (a result emerging in Chapter 3). Hegel
goes beyond Kant, however, and expanding on an idea found in Fichte,
makes this requirement dependent on one’s recognition (or
acknowledgment—&lt;em&gt;Anerkennung&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;em&gt;of other&lt;/em&gt;
self-conscious subjects &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; self-conscious subjects &lt;em&gt;for
whom&lt;/em&gt; any object of consciousness will be thought
as &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; existing. One’s self-consciousness, in fact,
will be dependent on one’s recognition of those others as
similarly recognizing &lt;em&gt;oneself&lt;/em&gt; as a self-conscious
subject. Such complex patterns of mutual recognition constituting
&lt;em&gt;objective spirit&lt;/em&gt; thereby provide the social matrix
within which individual self-consciousnesses can exist as such. It is
in this way that the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt; can change course, the
earlier tracking of shapes of individual consciousness and
self-consciousness effectively coming to be replaced by the tracking
of distinct patterns of mutual recognition between
subjects—shapes of spirit—that forms the
ground for the existence of those individual
consciousnesses/self-consciousnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is thus that Hegel has effected the transition from a
phenomenology of the individual’s subjective mind to one
of &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt; spirit, thought of as culturally distinct
objective patterns of social interaction to be analysed in terms of
the patterns of reciprocal recognition they
embody. (“Geist” can be translated as either
“mind” or “spirit”, but the latter, allowing a
more cultural sense, as in the phrase “spirit of the age”
(“Zeitgeist”), seems a more suitable rendering for the
title.) But this is only worked out in the text
gradually. We—the reading or so-called phenomenological
we—can see how particular shapes of self-consciousness, such as
that of the other-worldly religious self-consciousness (Unhappy
Consciousness) with which Chapter 4 ends, depend on certain
institutionalised forms of mutual recognition, in this case one
involving a priest who mediates between the self-conscious subject and
that subject’s God. But we are seeing this “from the
outside”, as it were: we still have to learn how actual
self-consciousnesses could learn this of themselves. So we have to see
how the protagonist self-consciousness could achieve this insight. It
is to this end that we further trace the learning path of
self-consciousness through the processes of &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; (in
Chapter 5) before objective spirit can become the explicit subject
matter of Chapter 6 (Spirit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hegel’s discussion of spirit starts from what he calls
&lt;em&gt;Sittlichkeit&lt;/em&gt; (translated as “ethical
order” or “ethical
substance”—“&lt;em&gt;Sittlichkeit&lt;/em&gt;” being a
nominalization from the adjectival (or adverbial) form
“&lt;em&gt;sittlich&lt;/em&gt;”, “customary”, from the
stem “&lt;em&gt;Sitte&lt;/em&gt;”, “custom” or
“convention”.) Thus Hegel might be seen as adopting the
viewpoint that since social life is ordered by customs we can approach
the lives of those living in it in terms of the patterns of those
customs or conventions themselves—the conventional practices, as
it were, constituting specific, shareable &lt;em&gt;forms of life&lt;/em&gt; made
actual in the lives of particular individuals who had in
turn &lt;em&gt;internalized&lt;/em&gt; such general patterns in the process of
acculturation. It is not surprising then that his account of spirit
here starts with a discussion of religious and civic law. Undoubtedly
it is Hegel’s tendency to nominalise such abstract concepts in
his attempt to capture the &lt;em&gt;concrete&lt;/em&gt; nature of such patterns
of conventional life, together with the tendency to
then &lt;em&gt;personify&lt;/em&gt; them (as in talking about
spirit &lt;em&gt;becoming&lt;/em&gt; self-conscious) that lends plausibility to
the traditionalist understanding of Hegel. But for non-traditionalists
it is not obvious that Hegel, in employing such phrases, is in any way
committed to any metaphysical supra-individual conscious being or
beings. To take an example, in the second section of the chapter on
spirit, Hegel discusses human culture as the
“world of self-alienated spirit”. The idea seems to be
that humans in society not only interact, but that they collectively
create relatively enduring cultural products (repeatable stories,
stageable dramas, and so forth) within which members of that society
can recognise patterns of their own communal life as so reflected. We
might find intelligible the metaphor that such products “hold up a
mirror to society” within which “the society can regard
itself”, without thinking we are thereby committed to some
supra-individual unitary mind achieving
self-consciousness. Furthermore, such cultural products
themselves provide conditions allowing individuals to adopt particular
cognitive attitudes by appropriating their resources. Thus, for
example, the capacity to adopt the type of objective viewpoint
demanded by Kantian morality (discussed in the final section of
Spirit)—the capacity to see things, as it were, from a detached
or universal point of view—might be enabled by
engaging with spirit’s “alienations” such as the
myths and rituals of a religion professing a universal scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might think that if Kant had written
Hegel’s &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt; he would have ended it at Chapter
6 with the modern moral subject as the &lt;em&gt;telos&lt;/em&gt; of the
story. For Kant, the practical knowledge of morality, orienting one
within the noumenal world, exceeds the scope of theoretical knowledge,
which had been limited to phenomena. Hegel, however, thought that
philosophy had to unify theoretical and practical knowledge, and so
the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt; has further to go. Again, this is seen
differently by traditionalists and revisionists. For traditionalists,
Chapters 7, Religion and 8, Absolute
Knowing, testify to Hegel’s disregard for Kant’s
critical limitation of theoretical knowledge to empirical
experience. Revisionists, on the other hand, tend to see Hegel as
furthering the Kantian critique into the very coherence of a
conception of an &lt;em&gt;in-itself&lt;/em&gt; reality that is beyond the
limits of our theoretical (but not practical) cognition.  Rather than
understand absolute knowing as the achievement of some
ultimate God’s-eye view of everything, the
philosophical analogue to the connection with God sought in religion,
post-Kantian revisionists see it as the accession to a mode of
self-critical thought that has finally abandoned all non-questionable
mythical &lt;em&gt;givens&lt;/em&gt;, and which will only countenance
reason-giving argument as justification. However we understand this,
absolute knowing is the standpoint to which Hegel has hoped to bring
the reader in this complex work. This is the standpoint of
&lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt;, the standpoint from which philosophy proper commences,
and it commences in Hegel’s next book, the &lt;em&gt;Science of
Logic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="SciLog"&gt;3.1.2 &lt;em&gt;Science of Logic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hegel’s &lt;em&gt;Science of Logic&lt;/em&gt; is divided into three
books, dealing with the topics &lt;em&gt;of
being&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;essence&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;the concept&lt;/em&gt;, which appeared
in 1812, 1813, and 1816 respectively. For most of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;
century it was not received with the enthusiasm that often marked the
reception of &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology of Spirit&lt;/em&gt;. First, as a work
of &lt;em&gt;logic&lt;/em&gt; most have regarded it as radically outdated and
relying on an Aristotelian approach that was definitively surpassed in
the later nineteenth century—a view promoted especially by
Bertrand Russell in the early years of the twentieth. Thus many
readers sympathetic to particular doctrines in Hegel have attempted,
contrary to Hegel’s insistence, to quarantine his philosophical
approach to particular areas from it. Recently, this skepticism has
started to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some advocate that the &lt;em&gt;Science of Logic&lt;/em&gt; be read as a
first-order &lt;em&gt;ontological&lt;/em&gt; doctrine (Doz 1987) or as a category
theory that &lt;em&gt;simultaneously&lt;/em&gt; represents structures of being and
thought (Houlgate 2005b), and so as having very little to do with what
has traditionally been known as logic. Others argue that
in contrast to the project of formal (or general) logic,
it is best understood as a version of what Kant had called
“transcendental logic” (di Giovanni 2010). In this sense
it should thereby be thought of as a successor to Kant’s
“transcendental deduction of the categories” in
the &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt; in which Kant attempted to
derive a list of those non-empirical concepts, the
&lt;em&gt;categories&lt;/em&gt;, which he believed to be presupposed by all
empirical judgments made by finite, discursive knowers like ourselves.
In short, taking the logic as a &lt;em&gt;category theory&lt;/em&gt; opens up two
general lines of interpretation: should the categories be understood
as primarily &lt;em&gt;ontological&lt;/em&gt; categories, as found in Aristotle,
or as primarily categories revealing the necessary structure
of &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt;, as in Kant? Those, such as the advocates of the
revised metaphysical interpretation, interpreting Hegel
as basically a metaphysician, typically stress the former, while
post-Kantian interpreters typically stress the
latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A glance at the table of contents of &lt;em&gt;Science of Logic&lt;/em&gt;
reveals the same triadic structuring among the categories or
thought determinations discussed that has been noted
among the shapes of consciousness in
the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt;. At the highest level of its branching
structure there are the three books devoted to the doctrines of
being, essence, and concept,
while in turn, each book has three sections, each section containing
three chapters, and so on. In general, each of these individual nodes
deals with some particular category. In fact, Hegel’s categorial
triads appear to repeat Kant’s &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; triadic way of
articulating the categories in the Table of Categories
(&lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt; A80/B106) in which the third term in
the triad in some way integrates the first two. (In Hegel’s
terminology, he would say that the first two were
&lt;em&gt;sublated&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;aufgehoben&lt;/em&gt;] in the third—while
the first two are &lt;em&gt;negated&lt;/em&gt; by the third, they continue to work
within the context defined by it.) Hegel’s later treatment
of &lt;em&gt;the syllogism&lt;/em&gt; found in Book 3, in which he follows
Aristotle’s own three-termed schematism of the syllogistic
structure, repeats this triadic structure as does his ultimate
analysis of its component concepts as the moments of
universality, particularity, and
singularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading into the first chapter of Book 1, Being, it
is quickly seen that the &lt;em&gt;transitions&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Logic&lt;/em&gt;
broadly repeat those of the first chapters of
the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt;, now, however, as between the categories
themselves rather than between conceptions of the
respective &lt;em&gt;objects&lt;/em&gt; of conscious experience. Thus,
being is the thought determination with which the work
commences because it &lt;em&gt;at first&lt;/em&gt; seems to be the most
immediate, fundamental determination that characterises
any possible thought content at all. (In contrast, &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; in
the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;em&gt;Sense-certainty&lt;/em&gt; chapter
was described as the known &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; of the purported immediate
sensory given—the category that it was discovered to
instantiate.)  Whatever thought is about, that topic must in some
sense &lt;em&gt;exist&lt;/em&gt;. Like those purported simple &lt;em&gt;sensory
givens&lt;/em&gt; with which the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt; starts, the
category &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; looks to have no internal structure or
constituents, but again in a parallel to the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt;,
it is the effort of thought to make this category explicit that both
undermines it and brings about new ones. &lt;em&gt;Being&lt;/em&gt; seems to
be &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; immediate and simple, but it will show itself to be,
in fact, &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; something in opposition to something else,
&lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;. The point seems to be that while the categories
being and nothing seem both absolutely
distinct and opposed, on reflection (and following Leibniz’s
principle of the identity of indiscernibles) they appear identical as
no criterion can be invoked which differentiates them. The only way
out of this paradox is to posit a third category within which they can
coexist as &lt;em&gt;negated&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Aufgehoben&lt;/em&gt;) moments. This
category is &lt;em&gt;becoming&lt;/em&gt;, which saves thinking from
paralysis because it accommodates both
concepts. Becoming contains being and
nothing in the sense that when something
&lt;em&gt;becomes&lt;/em&gt; it passes, as it were, from nothingness to
being. But these contents cannot be understood apart
from their contributions to the overarching category: this is what it
is to be negated (&lt;em&gt;aufgehoben&lt;/em&gt;) within the new category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general this is how the &lt;em&gt;Logic&lt;/em&gt; proceeds: seeking its
most basic and universal determination, thought posits a category to
be reflected upon, finds then that this collapses due to a
contradiction generated, like that generated by the
category being, and so then seeks a further category with which to
make retrospective senses of those contradictory categories. However,
in turn the new category will generate some further contradictory
negation and again the demand will arise for a &lt;em&gt;further&lt;/em&gt;
concept that can reconcile these opposed concepts by
incorporating &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; as moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method Hegel employs here, &lt;em&gt;determinate negation&lt;/em&gt;, is often
compared with Spinoza’s principle that “all determination
is negation”, but while Hegel’s is &lt;em&gt;related&lt;/em&gt; to
Spinoza’s thought, it cannot be identified with or reduced to
it.  Spinoza’s top-down determination starts with a single
category (in his case, &lt;em&gt;divine substance&lt;/em&gt;) that is then
progressively divided by the application of concepts—the model
being Plato’s method of division in which
a &lt;em&gt;genus&lt;/em&gt; concept is divided into particular &lt;em&gt;species&lt;/em&gt;
by the presence or absence of some differentiating property. From
Hegel’s point of view, however, this cannot
capture &lt;em&gt;individuals&lt;/em&gt; as other than &lt;em&gt;parts&lt;/em&gt; of that
greater whole—a metaphysical picture in relation to Spinoza he
refers to as &lt;em&gt;acosmism&lt;/em&gt;. So Hegel will
balance &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; type of determination by negation, with a
different type of negation modeled on that which holds
between &lt;em&gt;incompatible properties&lt;/em&gt; of some object (for example,
red and blue as incompatible colors) and that is reflected in the
&lt;em&gt;term negation&lt;/em&gt; of Aristotle’s logic. This allows
Hegel to go beyond the determination of something
as &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; (suggesting the part-whole relation) to a more
robust sense of &lt;em&gt;singularity&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;Einzelheit&lt;/em&gt;]—the
sense of the pure &lt;em&gt;thisness&lt;/em&gt; seen initially in
the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt;’s Sense-certainty chapter, the truth
of which was then shown to be Aristotle’s idea of an individual
thing’s substantial form in the Perception
chapter. It is in terms of this category that we can think, along with
Aristotle, of a thing having an underlying substrate within which
properties inhere and which, unlike the properties
themselves, cannot be thought in &lt;em&gt;general&lt;/em&gt; terms, but only in
terms of the category of &lt;em&gt;singularity&lt;/em&gt;. And yet this will
encounter a problem for the &lt;em&gt;determinacy&lt;/em&gt; of this underlying
substrate—&lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; will have to find determining contrasts
that allow &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; to be determinately conceived. (In Book 2 of
the &lt;em&gt;Logic&lt;/em&gt; we will learn that the category of singularity will
rely on particularity just as particularity has been shown to rely on
singularlity. Singular substrates or “essences” can only
be known in relation to the general properties that constitute their
appearances.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempting to unravel the intricacies of the patterns of dependence
between such categories will be task of this mammoth work, but here a
general point might be made. If Hegel’s thought here is
considered to be, like Spinoza’s, &lt;em&gt;holistic&lt;/em&gt;, it is only
so at a higher level of abstraction, such that these determinations
of &lt;em&gt;singularity&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;particularity&lt;/em&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;universality&lt;/em&gt; cannot themselves be understood in isolation
from each other but only via their complex interactions. Hegel
only &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt; explores the details of the interactions of
these determinations of conceptuality in his discussion of judgments
and syllogisms in Book 3, The Doctrine of Concept,
suggesting that concerns of logic as traditionally
conceived are not as irrelevant to the &lt;em&gt;Science of Logic&lt;/em&gt; as
often thought. However, the general point separating his approach from
that of Spinoza clearly emerges earlier on. Determinate negation is
not Spinoza’s principle as Spinoza’s presupposes a whole
that &lt;em&gt;precedes&lt;/em&gt; its parts, and that all &lt;em&gt;negations&lt;/em&gt; are
negations of something that is primitively &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt;. In
contrast, Hegel’s negations will be negations of determinations
that are &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; to be conceived as &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt;
negations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other basic methodological principle of the &lt;em&gt;Logic&lt;/em&gt; will
be that this categorical infrastructure of thought is able to be
unpacked using &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; the resources available to thought
itself: the capacity of thought to make its contents determinate (in a
way somewhat like what Leibniz had thought of as making clear but
confused ideas clear and distinct), and its capacity to be consistent
and avoid contradiction. Again, for some readers, this makes
Hegel’s logic akin to Kant’s transcendental logic that,
rather than treating the pure form of thought abstracted
from &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; content, treats thought as already possessing a
certain type of self-generated content, (in Kant’s terminology,
“transcendental content”) that is presupposed by the
subsequent acquisition of all &lt;em&gt;empirical&lt;/em&gt; content. But if
Hegel’s is akin to Kant’s transcendental logic, it has
clear differences to it as well. For Kant, transcendental logic was
the logic governing the thought of finite thinkers like ourselves,
whose cognition was constrained by the necessity of applying general
discursive concepts to the singular contents given in sensory
intuitions, and he contrasted this with the thought of a type of
thinker not so constrained—God—a thinker whose thought
could directly grasp the world in a type of intellectual
intuition. While opinions divide as to how Hegel’s approach to
logic relates to that of Kant, it is important to grasp that for Hegel
logic is not simply a science of the form of our thoughts. It is also
a science of actual &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; as well, and as such has an
ontological dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought determinations of Book 1 lead eventually into those of
Book 2, The Doctrine of Essence. Naturally the logical structures and
processes implicit in essence-thinking are more developed than those
of being-thinking. Crucially, the contrasting pair essence and
appearance of Essence-logic allow the thought of some underlying
reality that manifests itself &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; a different overlying
appearance, in the way that the &lt;em&gt;forces&lt;/em&gt; posited by the
operations of &lt;em&gt;the Understanding&lt;/em&gt; (explored in
the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt;’s Chapter 3) are grasped through the
appearances they explain. In contrast, the categories of Being-logic
seem to govern thought processes that are restricted to qualitative
phenomena and their co-ordinations. But distinction
between &lt;em&gt;essence&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;appearance&lt;/em&gt; must itself
instantiate the relation of determinate negation, and the metaphysical
tendency to think of reality as made up of some underlying substrates
in contrast to the superficial appearances will itself come to grief
with the discovery that the notion of an essence is only meaningful
in &lt;em&gt;virtue&lt;/em&gt; of the appearance that it is meant to explain
away. (In terms of the ultimate &lt;em&gt;conceptual&lt;/em&gt; categories of
singularity, particularity and universality, this discovery would be
equivalent to grasping the idea that the &lt;em&gt;singularity&lt;/em&gt; of the
underlying, non-perceivable substrate or substantial form is
meaningful only in relation to something that can bear
the &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; qualities that constitutes its worldly
appearance.) For Hegel it is the complex modern, but pre-Kantian,
versions of substance metaphysics, like those of Spinoza and Leibniz,
that bring out in the most developed way the inherently contradictory
nature of this form of thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book 3, The Doctrine of Concept, effects a shift from
the Objective Logic of Books 1 and 2, to
Subjective Logic, and metaphysically coincides with a
shift to the modern subject-based category theory of Kant. Just as
Kantian philosophy is founded on a conception of objectivity secured
by conceptual coherence, Concept-logic commences with the concept of
&lt;em&gt;concept&lt;/em&gt; itself, with its moments of singularity,
particularity and universality. While in the two books of objective
logic, the movement had been between particular concepts,
being, nothing, becoming
etc., in the subjective logic, the conceptual relations are grasped at
a meta-level, such that the concept &lt;em&gt;concept&lt;/em&gt; treated in
Chapter 1 of section 1 (Subjectivity) passes over into
that of &lt;em&gt;judgment&lt;/em&gt; in Chapter 2. It is important to grasp
the basic contours of Hegel’s treatment of judgment as it
informs his subsequent treatment of inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reprising an etymological point made by Hölderlin, Hegel notes
that a judgment (&lt;em&gt;Urteil&lt;/em&gt;) involves a separation
(&lt;em&gt;Teilung&lt;/em&gt;) of parts: in basic terms a predicate is said of
some subject giving the judgment the grammatical form “&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
is &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;”, but in &lt;em&gt;saying&lt;/em&gt;
“&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;”, the judging subject
affirms the &lt;em&gt;unity&lt;/em&gt; existing between the parts. &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; are thus meant (1) to be diverse, but (2) to form a
unity—a situation we are now familiar with in terms of
the &lt;em&gt;Aufhebung&lt;/em&gt; of parts in a whole. Hegel takes this as
signaling two ways of thinking of the relation of subject and
predicate in the judgment. One can take subject and predicate terms as
self-subsistent entities that are &lt;em&gt;joined&lt;/em&gt; in the judgment, or
one can take the judgment itself as the primary unit
that &lt;em&gt;splits&lt;/em&gt; into subject and predicate terms.  This in fact
coincides with the two different ways in which logical relations have
been conceived in the history of philosophy: the former represents
the &lt;em&gt;term-logical&lt;/em&gt; approach characteristic of Aristotle, while
the latter represents the &lt;em&gt;propositional&lt;/em&gt; approach
characteristic of the Stoics and much recent philosophy. From the
former point of view one thinks of the subject term as designating a
substance, typically grasped as an instance of a kind, in which
properties, designated by predicate terms, &lt;em&gt;inhere&lt;/em&gt;. From the
latter point of view, one thinks of predicate terms as abstract
universals that &lt;em&gt;subsume&lt;/em&gt; or are satisfied by entities to which
the subject terms refer, an approach which conceives of the
propositional content, in Stoic terminology—the
&lt;em&gt;lecton&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;what-is-said&lt;/em&gt;—as having a
primacy over the parts. Using a distinction from the Medievals, we can
describe the first type of judgments as &lt;em&gt;de re&lt;/em&gt; (about things)
and the second as &lt;em&gt;de dicto&lt;/em&gt; (about sayings). These
alternative &lt;em&gt;joining&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;splitting&lt;/em&gt; approaches can in
turn be applied to the relationship of &lt;em&gt;judgments&lt;/em&gt;
within &lt;em&gt;inferences&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;syllogisms&lt;/em&gt;. While it is more
common for inferences to be thought of as &lt;em&gt;composed&lt;/em&gt; of
judgments which have their own &lt;em&gt;truth values&lt;/em&gt;, the judgments
themselves can be thought of as gaining their meaning via the role
they play in inferences, parallel to the way that the &lt;em&gt;parts&lt;/em&gt;
of the judgment can be thought of as resulting from the
judgment’s &lt;em&gt;splitting&lt;/em&gt;.  Within recent semantic theory,
Robert Brandom has argued for such an &lt;em&gt;inferentialist&lt;/em&gt;
analysis and has suggested this way of understanding Hegel’s
logic (Brandom 2014), a view that fits with Hegel’s idea that
the &lt;em&gt;syllogism&lt;/em&gt; is the “truth of the judgment” (SL:
593). Thought of in terms of the framework of Kant’s
transcendental logic, Hegel’s position would be
akin to allowing inferences—syllogisms—a
role in the determination of the transcendental content
of judgments, a role that is not allowed in Kant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have said, Hegel’s logic is meant somehow to generate a
content—to &lt;em&gt;produce&lt;/em&gt; a type of ontology—and this
comes into explicit focus with Hegel’s puzzling claim in Book 3
concerning a syllogism that has become “concrete” and
“full of content” that thereby has &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;
existence (SL: 616–7). In contrast with Kant, Hegel seems to go
beyond a transcendental deduction of the &lt;em&gt;formal&lt;/em&gt; conditions of
experience and thought and to a deduction of their &lt;em&gt;material&lt;/em&gt;
conditions. Traditionalists will here point to Hegel’s allusions
to the ontological proof (SL: 625) of medieval theology in which
the &lt;em&gt;existence&lt;/em&gt; of God is seen as necessitated by his
concept—an argument undermined by Kant’s criticism of the
treatment of &lt;em&gt;existence&lt;/em&gt; as a predicate. In Hegel’s
version, it is said, the objective existence that God achieves in the
world is seen as necessitated by his essential
self-consciousness. Non-traditional readings, in contrast, would have
to interpret this aspect of Hegel’s logic very
differently. Brandom’s inferentialist interpretation of Hegel,
when joined to ideas taken from Hegel’s treatment of
self-consciousness in the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt;, suggests a way
forward here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to be emphasized here is that we shouldn’t
think of judgments and their contents as something
like &lt;em&gt;mental&lt;/em&gt; contents—subjective or psychological states
of a thinker’s mind.  Such a psychologistic
attitude was opposed by Hegel just as it was opposed by a figure as
central to modern logic as Gottlob Frege. For Frege, thoughts are not
mental, rather they are &lt;em&gt;abstract&lt;/em&gt; entities like
numbers, so the problem facing us is not how to go from mental
contents to the concrete world, it is how to go from &lt;em&gt;abstract&lt;/em&gt;
to concrete ones. But here we must keep in mind Hegel’s two-fold
way of thinking about judgments, &lt;em&gt;de dicto&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;de re&lt;/em&gt;,
and while it is usual to think of the contents of &lt;em&gt;de dicto&lt;/em&gt;
judgments as abstract (here to think of the content
as &lt;em&gt;propositional&lt;/em&gt; is usual), some have thought of the contents
of &lt;em&gt;de re&lt;/em&gt; judgments as including &lt;em&gt;the thing&lt;/em&gt; itself
(the “&lt;em&gt;re&lt;/em&gt;”) that the judgment is about.  (In fact
Bertrand Russell had, at points in his career, entertained such an
idea of &lt;em&gt;propositional content&lt;/em&gt; itself.) Thus when Hegel
characterizes some judgment structures (typically perception based
judgments) as &lt;em&gt;judgments of existence&lt;/em&gt; one might take the
perceived thing &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; as straightforwardly part of the
content of the judgment. It is a concrete object, but
not grasped as a concrete &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt;, but grasped in relation to
what is judged &lt;em&gt;of it&lt;/em&gt; in the predicate. And to the extent
that &lt;em&gt;judgments&lt;/em&gt; can be considered components of syllogisms, we
might appreciate how syllogisms might have become
contentful in a process that has culminated in the &lt;em&gt;concrete&lt;/em&gt; syllogism of
necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the concrete object of a &lt;em&gt;de re&lt;/em&gt; judgment is effectively
what had been under consideration in Chapter 2, Perception, in
the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt; (the thing with properties), we now might
envisage where Hegel’s thought is headed in these sections of
the subjective logic. In the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt; it turned out that
the capacity for a subject to entertain objects of consciousness such
as perceptual ones was that such a subject was capable
of &lt;em&gt;self-consciousness&lt;/em&gt;. It then turned out that to be capable
of self-consciousness the subject had to exist in a world with other
embodied subjects whose intentions it could recognize. It is here that
we might pick up Robert Brandom’s suggestion, following Sellars,
that we should think of the existence of inferential processes or
processes of reasoning as presupposing participation within social
communicative interactions in which the making of an assertion is
considered as a move in a language-game of the “giving and
asking for reasons”. In short, we may think of Hegel’s
syllogism of necessity, which constitutes the ground or
“truth” of the earlier &lt;em&gt;formal&lt;/em&gt; conception of
syllogisms, as a type of inter-subjective practice embodying
thought—a type of &lt;em&gt;syllogising&lt;/em&gt; practice that is by
necessity inter-subjective and recognitive. Formally considered we
might think of this syllogism as the logical schematization of the
most &lt;em&gt;developed&lt;/em&gt; form of recognition in which thinkers
acknowledge others &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; free thinkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have suggested that in the syllogism of necessity with which
Hegel’s treatment of inference terminates we get a glimpse of a
type of contentful and dynamic rational process unfolding in the midst
of the recognitive and communicative interactions between finite
living and intentional beings. What we see here is a reprise of the
conception of logos as an objective process running through the world
as had been conceived by the ancient Stoics and neo-Platonists. But it
is now embedded not simply in the world as
such—in &lt;em&gt;nature&lt;/em&gt;—but in
objectivized &lt;em&gt;spirit&lt;/em&gt;, in human communities of thinkers. We are
now returned to the domain of &lt;em&gt;objectivity&lt;/em&gt; that had
characterized Books 1 and 2 of the &lt;em&gt;Science of Logic&lt;/em&gt;, but we
might expect such a return &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; subjectivity to have effected
a change in &lt;em&gt;objectivity&lt;/em&gt; as earlier understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cross straight into a consideration of the objectivity of the
human world of action and thought—spirit—would be to break
the developmental pattern of the logic because thought about such a
complex form of objective existence will presuppose thought about
simpler forms. And so the starting point for the consideration of
objectivity will again be that of the simple object as something
immediately grasped by thought. But this object can now be
developed with that elaborate conceptual apparatus that
has emerged in the preceding section. Progression here will be from a
naïve and immediate concept of an object as simple
self-sufficient thing, a thing with its identity centered on itself,
through the more complex idea of an object as grasped from within the
interstices of physical and chemical thought, to the models of
teleological and living systems. The &lt;em&gt;Logic&lt;/em&gt; then transitions
into a consideration of the “&lt;em&gt;adequate concept&lt;/em&gt;, the
objectively &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;, or the &lt;em&gt;true as such&lt;/em&gt;” (SL:
670). This adequate concept is &lt;em&gt;the Idea&lt;/em&gt;, which, after tracking through
considerations of the living individual and theoretical and
practical cognition, emerges as &lt;em&gt;the Absolute Idea&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="HegEncSysExp"&gt;3.2 Hegel’s &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedic&lt;/em&gt; System and its Expansions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have mentioned, Hegel’s &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia of
Philosophical Sciences&lt;/em&gt; was written as a teaching manual, various
parts of which were later expanded upon in lecture courses devoted to
specific parts of the system. The first part of
the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia&lt;/em&gt; is essentially a condensed version of his
earlier &lt;em&gt;Science of Logic&lt;/em&gt;, considered above. We will pass over
a consideration of this work to the next component of
the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia&lt;/em&gt;, Hegel’s &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of
Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="Nat"&gt;3.2.1. Philosophy of Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hegel’s &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of Nature&lt;/em&gt; (first published as
such in 1842, and based on §§245–376 from the
1830 &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia&lt;/em&gt;, supplemented by material and student
transcripts from Hegel’s Berlin lectures) has often been damned
by the contention that Hegel had simply &lt;em&gt;dismissed&lt;/em&gt; the
activity of the natural sciences, especially Newtonian science, as
based upon the inadequacies of the Understanding, and in
their place had tried to somehow deduce the natural
world from philosophical first principles. Recently, however, defenses
of Hegel’s philosophy of science have started to emerge,
especially from the side of Hegel’s reformed
metaphysical interpreters. Thus, it has been argued by Westphal
(2008) for example, that Hegel’s philosophy of nature actually
represents a sophisticated attempt to think through epistemological
assumptions that are presupposed by the development of Newton’s
theory. Defending Hegel’s philosophy of science from a similar
point of view, James Kreines (2008) has argued for the relevance of
Hegel’s logical categories for the biological sciences of his
times. We won’t here attempt to present such arguments, but
before any such reassessment of Hegel’s work here &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;
be undertaken, the fundamental criticism raised above of a project
that attempts to base a philosophy of nature on his logic rather than
the empirical sciences must be addressed. Was not Hegel simply trying
to pre-empt the work of empirical scientists by somehow attempting to
anticipate the very &lt;em&gt;contents&lt;/em&gt; of their discoveries from
logical considerations alone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This objection is often summed up under the slogan of
“deducing Krug’s pen”, in that in 1801 the
philosopher W.T. Krug had accused &lt;em&gt;Schelling&lt;/em&gt;’s idealist
philosophy of nature of aiming to deduce the nature of all contingent
phenomena, even that of the pen with which he, Krug, was writing his
critique. Hegel responded to Krug’s accusation in the following
year, claiming that Krug had made the common mistake of conflating the
understanding with reason, and treating the Absolute as something on
the same level as finite things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hegel was, at this time, closely aligned with Schelling’s
views, and would separate his own views &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt;
Schelling’s in subsequent years leading up to the writing
of &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology of Spirit&lt;/em&gt;. Nevertheless, Hegel clearly
thought that his point held regardless of the relation of his own
views to Schelling’s as he was to make similar points against
Krug in a remark added to the &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of Nature&lt;/em&gt; from the
Heidelberg and Berlin periods. While logic must not be restricted to
the “form” of an externally given “matter”,
nevertheless,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;it is the height of pointlessness to demand of the
concept that it should explain … construe or deduce these
contingent products of nature. (PN: §250, remark. Krug is
mentioned explicitly in a footnote at this point.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The point is expanded upon further when it is
said that it is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;an error on the part of the philosophy of nature
to attempt to face up to all phenomena; this is done in the finite
sciences, where everything has to be reduced to general conceptions
(hypotheses). In these sciences the empirical element is the sole
confirmation of the hypothesis, so that everything has to be
explained.  (PN: §270, addition)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the more general idea that that philosophy attempts
to discern or recognize &lt;em&gt;concepts&lt;/em&gt; in
&lt;em&gt;representations&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Vorstellungen&lt;/em&gt;) or empirical appearances, philosophy of
nature investigates the conceptual structures that are manifest in the
products of the scientific work that is done on the basis of those
appearances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traces of conceptual determination will certainly
survive in the most particularized product, although they will not
exhaust its nature. (PN: §250 remark)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Clearly, philosophy of nature is not in competition with the empirical
natural sciences; it takes as its subject matter the results of those
sciences in order to discover within them the particular ways in which
the necessary categorial structures deduced in the logic are
expressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of topics treated, the &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of Nature&lt;/em&gt;
largely coincides with those treated in the third book of
the &lt;em&gt;Science of Logic&lt;/em&gt; when the logical processes and relations
in question have returned to objectivity after the
excursion into the &lt;em&gt;subjectivity&lt;/em&gt; of formal logic at the outset
of Book 3.  In Mechanism Hegel had reconstructed a
movement in thought from a primitive cosmology in which all objects
are conceived in relation to a central object (the sun) that
exemplifies objecthood &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;, to a system of objects within
which any such self-sufficient center has been
eliminated. In this Newtonian world, that which gives order to the
whole now has the ideality of law, but this
is &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; thought of as external to the system
of objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an Introduction, Section One of
the &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of Nature&lt;/em&gt;, Mechanics, expands on this
progression through considerations of space and time, matter
considered as the diversity of individual bodies distributed in space
and time, and finally the idea of universal gravitation as the
determinate concept of such corporeal matter realized as &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt;
(PN: §270). In the Newtonian laws of mechanics, however, the
unity of matter is still only &lt;em&gt;formal&lt;/em&gt;, and in Section
Two, Physics, the determinateness of form is now considered
as &lt;em&gt;immanent within&lt;/em&gt; such corporeal matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matter has individuality to the extent that it is
determined within itself by having being-for-self developed within
it. It is through this determination that matter breaks away from
gravity and manifests itself as implicitly self-determining. (PN:
§273)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While Mechanics clearly reflects the
more space-filling conception of matter dominant in
British thought, Physics is consistent with the more
dynamic continental European conception of matter
originating in Leibniz with his idea of living
forces. Within this framework, Hegel attempts to organize a
vast array of areas of contemporary physical investigation including
meteorology, theories of sound and heat, light and electricity up to
and including &lt;em&gt;chemical&lt;/em&gt; processes which stand on the
threshold of Organic Physics, dealt with in Section
Three. The study of organics represents a return to the consideration
of the individual &lt;em&gt;body&lt;/em&gt; with which Mechanics had
started, but now considered as “infinite process in which
the individuality determines itself as the &lt;em&gt;particularity or
finitude&lt;/em&gt; which it also negates, and returns into itself by
re-establishing itself at the end of the process as the beginning”. The
body is now “an &lt;em&gt;impregnated&lt;/em&gt; and negative unity, which
by relating itself to itself, has become essentially &lt;em&gt;self-centred
and subjective&lt;/em&gt;” (PN: §337). From such a conception,
the first &lt;em&gt;body&lt;/em&gt; to be considered is that of &lt;em&gt;the earth
itself&lt;/em&gt;, along with its history. Chapter Two moves to a
consideration of the plant and Chapter Three, the animal
organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the point of view of the actual content of scientific theories
and approaches that Hegel summarizes and locates within his system,
his &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of Nature&lt;/em&gt; is clearly a product of his time.
Nevertheless, many of the underlying philosophical issues dealt with
are still now far from settled. Thus, while Newtonian physics clearly
became established in ways that made Leibniz’s dynamic physics
seem obsolete as &lt;em&gt;empirical&lt;/em&gt; theory, debate still goes on as to
whether conceptions of space-time in post-Newtonian physics is to be
conceived in Newtonian or Leibnizian ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="SubObjSpi"&gt;3.2.2 Philosophy of Subjective and Objective Spirit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of Nature&lt;/em&gt; is
followed by &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of Spirit&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Geist&lt;/em&gt;).
Hegel’s usual triadic pattern when applied here results in
sections devoted to the philosophies of subjective spirit, objective
spirit, and absolute spirit. Philosophy of &lt;em&gt;subjective&lt;/em&gt; spirit
constitutes what is closest in Hegel’s philosophy to a
philosophy of mind in the contemporary sense, while the philosophy
of &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt; spirit concerns those objective patterns of
social interaction and the cultural institutions within which spirit
is objectified in patterns of human life we have seen at work
in &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology of Spirit&lt;/em&gt;. Within subjective spirit, we may
anticipate that the first division, Anthropology, will
follow on from topics with which &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of Nature&lt;/em&gt;
ends—the animal organism—and so it does. Thus here Hegel
is concerned with what he terms “&lt;em&gt;Seele&lt;/em&gt;”,
“soul”—which seems to translate more the ancient
Greek term, “psyche”—and hence
the &lt;em&gt;mind-body&lt;/em&gt; relation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If soul and body are absolutely opposed to one
another as is maintained by the abstractive intellectual consciousness,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hegel comments,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;then there is no possibility of any community
between them. The community was, however, recognized by ancient
metaphysics as an undeniable fact. (PN: § 389
add)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Seele&lt;/em&gt; of Anthropology should therefore not be
confused with the modern subjective conception of mind, as exemplified
by Descartes and other early modern philosophers. Aristotle had
conceived of the soul as the &lt;em&gt;form&lt;/em&gt; of the body, not as a
substance separate from that of the body, and had attributed lesser
souls to animals and even plants. (Again, Aristotle’s notion of
&lt;em&gt;substantial form&lt;/em&gt; comes into view.) Concomitantly, in
this section Hegel describes spirit as &lt;em&gt;sunk&lt;/em&gt; in nature,
and treats consciousness as largely limited to what now might be
described as &lt;em&gt;sentient&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;phenomenal&lt;/em&gt; consciousness
alone—the feeling soul. &lt;em&gt;Consciousness&lt;/em&gt; in
the sense of the modern subject–object opposition only makes its
appearance in the following second section, Phenomenology of
Spirit, which, reprising key moments from the earlier book of
that name, raises a problem for how we are to understand the relation
of phenomenology and systematic philosophy: is it
a &lt;em&gt;path&lt;/em&gt; to it or &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of it? Given that the
recognitive approach to self-consciousness &lt;em&gt;presupposes&lt;/em&gt; that
potential self-consciousnesses are &lt;em&gt;in fact&lt;/em&gt; embodied and
located in the world, we would expect the mind as treated
in Psychology to be no less embodied as the way in which it
is conceived in Anthropology. What in fact distinguishes the
mind of Psychology from that of Anthropology is its
rational capacities, considered in terms that would now be described
as normative rather than simply naturalistic, and this
for Hegel clearly signals a difference in the way in which an actual
psychological subject &lt;em&gt;relates to&lt;/em&gt; his or her own body. The
type of &lt;em&gt;abstractive&lt;/em&gt; thinking found in Psychology
does not, of course, as in mythical images of metempsychosis—a
favorite trope of Platonists—involve the mind leaving
the body.  This would count for Hegel as a piece of mythical
picture thinking—a &lt;em&gt;Vorstellung.&lt;/em&gt; Rather,
it involves a certain capacity of the psychological subject to suspend
unreflected-upon endorsement of the &lt;em&gt;claims&lt;/em&gt; made on behalf of
his or her body, for example, to subject the evidence
given by the senses to rational scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the dialectical mode in which Hegel’s texts progress,
as seen already in both &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology of Spirit&lt;/em&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;Science of Logic&lt;/em&gt;, we will expect the capacities examined
in Psychology to ultimately depend upon those that come under
consideration in the context of &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt; spirit. In this
sense, we are witnessing within another mode, the type of progression
seen in the movement in Phenomenology from shapes of
consciousness to shapes of spirit. The
internal &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology of Spirit&lt;/em&gt; seems to play an important
role in setting up this transition from Psychology
to &lt;em&gt;Objective Spirit&lt;/em&gt; (Williams 2007), but it might also be
seen as crucial in relating the more cognitive dimensions
of Psychology back to the theme of embodiment prominent
in Anthropology (Nuzzo 2013a).Thus any &lt;em&gt;naturalistic analysis&lt;/em&gt; is ultimately
surpassed by a social and historical one, which &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; cannot
be understood as &lt;em&gt;anti&lt;/em&gt;-naturalistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The philosophy of &lt;em&gt;subjective&lt;/em&gt; spirit passes over into that
of &lt;em&gt;objective spirit&lt;/em&gt;, which concerns the objective patterns of
social interaction and the cultural institutions within which spirit
is objectified. The book entitled &lt;em&gt;Elements of the Philosophy of
Right&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1821 as a textbook to accompany Hegel’s
lectures at the University of Berlin, essentially corresponds to a
more developed version of the philosophy of objective spirit and will
be considered here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Elements of the Philosophy of Right&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of Right&lt;/em&gt; (as it is more commonly called)
can be read as a political philosophy that stands independently of the
system (Tunick 1992), despite the fact that Hegel intended it to be
read against the background of the developing conceptual
determinations of the &lt;em&gt;Logic&lt;/em&gt;. The text proper starts from the
conception of a singular willing subject (grasped from the point of
view of its individual self-consciousness) as the bearer of
&lt;em&gt;abstract&lt;/em&gt; right. While this conception of the individual
willing subject possessing some kind of fundamental rights was in fact
the starting point of many modern political philosophies (such as that
of Locke, for example) the fact that Hegel commences here does not
testify to any ontological assumption that the consciously willing and
right-bearing individual is the basic atom from which all society can
be understood as constructed—an idea at the heart of standard
social contract theories. Rather, this is simply the
most immediate starting point of Hegel’s
presentation and corresponds to analogous starting places of
the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Logic&lt;/em&gt;. Just as the
categories of the &lt;em&gt;Logic&lt;/em&gt; develop in a way meant to demonstrate
that what had at the start been conceived as simple is in fact only
made determinate in virtue of its being a functional part of some
larger structure or process, here too it is meant to be shown that any
simple willing and right-bearing subject only gains its determinacy in
virtue of a place it finds for itself in a larger social, and
ultimately historical, structure or process. Thus, even a contractual
exchange (the minimal social interaction for contract theorists) is
not to be thought simply as an occurrence consequent upon the
existence of two beings with natural animal wants and some natural
calculative rationality, as in Hobbes, say; rather, the system of
interaction within which individual exchanges take place (the economy)
will be treated holistically as a culturally-shaped form of social
life within which the actual wants of individuals as well as their
reasoning powers are given determinate forms. Hegel is well aware of
the distinctive modernity of this form of social-life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here too it becomes apparent that Hegel, taking up themes from
the Phenomenology, follows Fichte in treating property in
terms of a &lt;em&gt;recognitive&lt;/em&gt; analysis of the nature of such a
right. A contractual exchange of commodities between two individuals
itself involves an implicit act of recognition in as much as each, in
giving something to the other in exchange for what they want, is
thereby recognizing that other &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; a proprietor of that thing,
or, more properly, of the inalienable &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; attaching to it
(PR: §§72–81). By contrast, such proprietorship would
be &lt;em&gt;denied&lt;/em&gt; rather than recognised in fraud or
theft—forms of wrong (&lt;em&gt;Unrecht&lt;/em&gt;) in which
right is negated rather than acknowledged or posited
(§§82–93). Thus what differentiates property from
mere &lt;em&gt;possession&lt;/em&gt; is that it is grounded in a relation of
reciprocal recognition between two willing subjects (§71 and
remark). Moreover, it is in the exchange relation that we can see what
it means for Hegel for individual subjects to share a &lt;em&gt;common
will&lt;/em&gt;—an idea which will have important implications with
respect to the difference of Hegel’s conception of the state
from that of Rousseau. Such an interactive constitution of the common
will means that for Hegel that the identity among wills is
achieved &lt;em&gt;because of&lt;/em&gt; not &lt;em&gt;in spite of&lt;/em&gt; co-existing
differences between the particular wills of the subjects involved:
while contracting individuals both will &lt;em&gt;the
same&lt;/em&gt; exchange, at a more concrete level, they do so with
different ends in mind. Each wants something different &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt;
the exchange. Without this difference, the type of
absorption of individual subjects into
collective &lt;em&gt;substance&lt;/em&gt; of the type of Hegel worries about in
relation to Spinoza would occur (§258 remark).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hegel passes from the abstractly individualistic frame of
Abstract Right to the social determinacies of
&lt;em&gt;Sittlichkeit&lt;/em&gt; or Ethical Life (PR: §142) via
considerations first of &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, the negation of right,
(§§82–96) and the punishment that such wrong entails
the negation of wrong, and hence the “negation of the
negation” of the original right (§§97–104), and
then of &lt;em&gt;morality&lt;/em&gt;, conceived more or less as an
internalisation of the external legal relations presupposed by
punishment. Consideration of Hegel’s version of the
retributivist approach to punishment affords a good example of his use
of the logic of negation. In punishing the criminal the state makes it
clear to its members that it is the acknowledgment of right &lt;em&gt;per
se&lt;/em&gt; that is essential to developed social life: the significance
of acknowledging another’s right in the contractual exchange
cannot be, as it at first might have appeared to the participants,
simply that of an instrumental means by which each gets what he or she
wants from the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hegel’s treatment of punishment also brings out the
continuity of his way of conceiving of the structure and dynamics of
the social world with that of Kant, as Kant too, in
his &lt;em&gt;Metaphysics of Morals&lt;/em&gt; had employed the idea of the
state’s punitive action as a &lt;em&gt;negating&lt;/em&gt; of the original
criminal act. Kant’s idea, conceived on the model of the
physical principle of action and reaction, was structured by the
category of community or reciprocal interaction, and was
conceived as involving what he called &lt;em&gt;real
opposition&lt;/em&gt;. Such an idea of opposed dynamic forces seems to
form something of a model for Hegel’s idea of contradiction and
the starting point for his conception of reciprocal
recognition. Nevertheless, clearly Hegel articulates the structures of
recognition in more complex ways than those derivable from
Kant’s category of community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, in Hegel’s analysis of &lt;em&gt;Sittlichkeit&lt;/em&gt;
the type of sociality found in the market-based civil
society is to be understood as dependent upon and in
contrastive opposition with the more immediate form found in the
institution of the family: a form of sociality mediated by a
quasi-natural inter-subjective recognition rooted in sentiment and
feeling—love (PR: §§ 158–60). (This dependence
shows how &lt;em&gt;anthropological&lt;/em&gt; determinations do not simply
disappear with the development of more &lt;em&gt;psychological&lt;/em&gt;
ones—they are &lt;em&gt;preserved&lt;/em&gt; as well as
&lt;em&gt;negated&lt;/em&gt; as in the pattern of what
is &lt;em&gt;aufgehoben&lt;/em&gt;. It also shows the mutual dependence of the
determinations of the &lt;em&gt;singularity&lt;/em&gt; of the atomistic subjects
of civil society and their &lt;em&gt;particularity&lt;/em&gt; as members (parts)
of holistically conceived families.) Here Hegel seems to have extended
Fichte’s legally characterized notion of recognition into the
types of human inter-subjectivity earlier broached by Hölderlin
and the romantics. In the family the particularity of each individual
tends to be absorbed into the social unit (one is a &lt;em&gt;part of&lt;/em&gt;
one’s family), giving this manifestation
of &lt;em&gt;Sittlichkeit&lt;/em&gt; a one-sidedness that is the inverse of that
found in market relations in which participants grasp themselves in
the first instance as &lt;em&gt;singular&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;einzeln&lt;/em&gt;]
self-identical individuals who &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; enter into relationships
that are external to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two opposite but interlocking principles of social existence
provide the basic structures in terms of which the component parts of
the modern state are articulated and understood. As both contribute
particular characteristics to the subjects involved in them, part of
the problem for the rational state will be to ensure that each of
these two principles mediates the other, each thereby mitigating
the &lt;em&gt;one-sidedness&lt;/em&gt; of the other. Thus, individuals who
encounter each other in the external relations of the
market place and who have their subjectivity shaped by such relations
also belong to families where they are subject to opposed
influences. Moreover, even within the ensemble of production and
exchange mechanisms of civil society individuals will belong to
particular &lt;em&gt;estates&lt;/em&gt; (the agricultural estate, that of
trade and industry, and the &lt;em&gt;universal&lt;/em&gt; estate of civil
servants (PR: §§199–208)), whose internal forms of
sociality will show family-like features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the actual details of Hegel’s mapping
of the categorical structures of the &lt;em&gt;Logic&lt;/em&gt; onto
the &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of Right&lt;/em&gt; are far from clear, the general
motivation is apparent.  Hegel’s logical categories can be read
as an attempt to provide a schematic account of the material (rather
than formal) conditions required for developed self-consciousness for
whom rationality and freedom are maximized. Thus we might regard the
various syllogisms of Hegel’s &lt;em&gt;Subjective
Logic&lt;/em&gt; as attempts to chart the skeletal structures of those
different types of recognitive inter-subjectivity necessary to sustain
various aspects of rational cognitive and conative functioning
(self-consciousness). From this perspective, we might
see his logical schematisation of the modern
rational state as a way of displaying just those sorts
of mediating institutions that a state must provide if it is to answer
Rousseau’s question of the form of association needed for the
formation and expression of the &lt;em&gt;general will&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concretely, for Hegel it is representation of the estates within
the legislative bodies that is to achieve this (PR:
§§301–14). As the estates of civil society group their
members according to their common interests, and as the deputies
elected from the estates to the legislative bodies give voice to those
interests within the deliberative processes of legislation, the
outcome of this process might give expression to the general
interest. But Hegel’s republicanism is here
balanced by his invocation of the familial principle: such
representative bodies can only provide the &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; of the
legislation to a &lt;em&gt;constitutional monarch&lt;/em&gt; who must add to it
the form of the royal decree—an individual “I will
…” (§§275–81). To declare that for Hegel
the monarch plays only a symbolic role here is to miss
the fundamentally idealist complexion of his political philosophy. The
expression of the general will in legislation cannot be thought of as
an outcome of some quasi-mechanical process: it must
be &lt;em&gt;willed&lt;/em&gt;. If legislation is to express the general will,
citizens must recognize it as expressing &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; wills; and
this means, recognising it &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; willed. The monarch’s
explicit “I will” is thus needed to close this recognitive
circle, lest legislation look like a mechanical compromise resulting
from a clash of contingent interests, and so as
actively &lt;em&gt;willed&lt;/em&gt; by nobody. Thus while Hegel is critical of
standard social contract theories, his own conception of
the state is still clearly a complicated transformation of those of
Rousseau and Kant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the most influential parts of
Hegel’s &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of Right&lt;/em&gt; concerns his analysis of
the contradictions of the unfettered capitalist economy. On the one
hand, Hegel agreed with Adam Smith that the interlinking of productive
activities allowed by the modern market meant that “subjective
selfishness” turned into a “contribution towards the
satisfaction of the needs of everyone else” (PR: §199). But
this did not mean that he accepted Smith’s idea that this
“general plenty” produced thereby &lt;em&gt;diffused&lt;/em&gt; (or
“trickled down”) though the rest of society. From within
the type of consciousness generated within civil society, in which
individuals are grasped as &lt;em&gt;bearers of rights&lt;/em&gt; abstracted
from the particular concrete relationships to which they belong,
Smithean optimism may seem justified. But this simply attests to the
one-sidedness of this type of abstract thought, and the need for it to
be mediated by the type of consciousness based in the family in which
individuals are grasped in terms of the way they &lt;em&gt;belong to&lt;/em&gt;
the social body. In fact, the unfettered operation of the
market &lt;em&gt;produces&lt;/em&gt; a class caught in a spiral of poverty.
Starting from this analysis, Marx later used it as evidence of the
need to abolish the individual proprietorial rights at the heart of
Hegel’s civil society and socialise the means of
production.  Hegel, however, did not draw this conclusion. His
conception of the exchange contract as a form of recognition that
played an essential role within the state’s capacity to provide
the conditions for the existence of rational and free-willing subjects
would certainly prevent such a move. Rather, the economy was to be
contained within an over-arching institutional framework of the state,
and its social effects offset by welfarist intervention. Some of
Hegel’s most telling criticisms of the unmediated effects of
modern civil society concern those on the psychological lives of
individuals. Recently, an approach to social reality with Hegelian
provenance that uses the notion of recognition to articulate such
pathologies has been developed by Axel Honneth (2010),
testifying to the continuing relevance of Hegel’s analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Philosophy of History&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final 20 paragraphs of the &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of Right&lt;/em&gt; (and
the final 5 paragraphs of objective spirit section of
the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia&lt;/em&gt;) are devoted to &lt;em&gt;world history&lt;/em&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;die Weltgeschichte&lt;/em&gt;), and they also coincide with the point
of transition from objective to &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt; spirit. We have
already seen the relevance of historical issues for Hegel in the
context of the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology of Spirit&lt;/em&gt;, such that a series of
different forms of objective spirit can be grasped in terms of the
degree to which they enable the development of a universalizable
self-consciousness capable of rationality and freedom. Hegel was to
enlarge on these ideas in a lecture series given five times during his
Berlin period, and it was &lt;em&gt;via&lt;/em&gt; the text assembled on the basis
of these lectures by his son Karl, that many readers would be
introduced to Hegel’s ideas after his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World history is made up of the histories of &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt;
peoples within which spirit assumes some “particular principle
on the lines of which it must run through a development of its
consciousness and its actuality” (PM: §548). Just the same
dialectic that we have first seen operative among shapes of
consciousness in the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt; and among categories or
thought-determinations in the &lt;em&gt;Logic&lt;/em&gt; can be observed here. An
historical community &lt;em&gt;acts&lt;/em&gt; on the principle that informs its
social life, the experience and memory of this action and the
consequences it brings—a memory encoded in the stories that
circulate in the community—results in this principle becoming
available for the self-consciousness of the community, thus breaking
the &lt;em&gt;immediacy&lt;/em&gt; of its operation. This loss of immediacy brings
about the decline of that community but gives rise to the principle of
a new community:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;in rendering itself objective and making this its
being an object of thought, [spirit] on the one hand destroys the
determinate form of its being, and on the other hand gains a
comprehension of the universal element which it involves, and thereby
gives a new form to its inherent principle … [which] has risen
into another, and in fact a higher principle.  (PWH: 81)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This dialectic linking concrete communities into a
developmental narrative which shows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;the path of liberation for the spiritual
substance, the deed by which the absolute final aim of the world is
realized in it, and the merely implicit mind achieves consciousness
and self-consciousness. (PM: §549)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is a dialectic, however, which only passes
 through &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; communities. Hegel’s is a
 clearly &lt;em&gt;Eurocentric&lt;/em&gt; account of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is thus that “the analysis of the successive grades [of
universal history] in their abstract form belongs to logic”
(PWH: 56), but once more, it must be stressed that, as with philosophy
of nature, philosophy of history is not meant to somehow
magically &lt;em&gt;deduce&lt;/em&gt; actual empirical historical phenomena, like
Krug’s pen; rather, it takes the results of actual empirical
history as its material and attempts to find exemplified within this
material the sorts of categorial progressions of the logic. Thus the
activity of the philosophical historian presupposes that of
“original” and “reflective” historians (PWH:
1–8). The actual world is full of contingencies from which
empirical historians will have already abstracted in constructing
their narratives, for example, when writing from
particular &lt;em&gt;national&lt;/em&gt; perspectives. To grasp
history &lt;em&gt;philosophically&lt;/em&gt;, however, will be to grasp it
from &lt;em&gt;the perspective of world-history&lt;/em&gt; itself, and this
provides the transition to &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt; spirit, as world history
will understood in terms of the manifestation of what from a religious
perspective is called “God”, or from a philosophical
perspective, “reason”. Hegel clearly thinks that there is
a way of cognitively relating to history in a way that goes beyond the
standpoint of consciousness and the
understanding—the standpoint of what we now think of as
informing scientific history. From the perspective of consciousness
history is something that stands over against me &lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt;
something known, but from the standpoint
of &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt;-consciousness I grasp this history as the history of
that which contributes to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, qua rational and free
being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="AbsSpi"&gt;3.2.3 Philosophy of Absolute Spirit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subject matter of the final 25 paragraphs of
the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia Philosophy of Spirit&lt;/em&gt;, Absolute
Spirit, came to be expanded massively into the contents of
three different lectures series on philosophy of art, religion, and
history of philosophy given multiple times during Hegel’s decade in
Berlin. Assembled and published in the years immediately following his
death, these were the works through which Hegel was to become known as
perhaps the most significant synoptic theorist of these cultural
phenomena. Rather than to attempt to capture the richness of his
thought here in a few paragraphs, which would be bound to be futile, I
will simply try to allude to how this material is meant to draw upon
the conceptual resources noted so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Art&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hegel was writing in a time of intense development of ideas about
the arts. Kant had treated aesthetic experience largely in relation to
the experience of the beauty of nature, but for Hegel aesthetics
becomes primarily about &lt;em&gt;art&lt;/em&gt;. The reason for this is simple:
art is an objective medium in which a community collectively reflects
upon itself, and the art of historical peoples is to be understood
as the attempt to bring before the consciousnesses of its members the
totality of what is. It is &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; art that “consciousness
of the Absolute first takes shape” (PM: §556). The
peculiarity of art lie in the &lt;em&gt;sensuousness&lt;/em&gt; of the medium in
which its content is objectified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1790s, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich Schlegel had given
aesthetics an historical dimension, distinguishing the forms of
ancient and modern art in terms of the contrasts
naïve–sentimental and classical–romantic
respectively. Hegel adopts Schlegel’s terminology to distinguish
as &lt;em&gt;classical&lt;/em&gt; the art that thrived in the Greek and Roman
worlds from the &lt;em&gt;romantic&lt;/em&gt; art of post-classical
times. Again, the romantic or modern here will be characterized by the
depth of a form of individual &lt;em&gt;subjective&lt;/em&gt; consciousness that
is largely missing in antiquity. But those in Greek antiquity,
where &lt;em&gt;psychological&lt;/em&gt; determinations were closer
to &lt;em&gt;anthropological&lt;/em&gt; ones, had lived with a comfortable felt
unity between spirit and body and between the individual and
society. A characteristic of the Greeks was their
&lt;em&gt;Heimatlichkeit&lt;/em&gt;—their collective feeling
of being &lt;em&gt;at home&lt;/em&gt; in the world as they were each
at home in their bodies. Modern subjectivity is thereby
purchased as the expense of a sense of &lt;em&gt;abstraction&lt;/em&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;alienation&lt;/em&gt; from the actual world and from the
self—a consequence of the way the modern subject has become
related to his or her body in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hegel, influenced by the work of a former colleague, the Heidelberg
philologist Friedrich Creuzer, adds to Schlegel’s categorization
of art forms by positing a further category of &lt;em&gt;symbolic&lt;/em&gt;
art, characterizing the material cultures of ancient Eastern
civilizations such as Persia, India and Egypt. The symbolic art of
pantheistic religions of the East used &lt;em&gt;natural elements&lt;/em&gt; to
symbolize the gods of their cultures: Zoroastrianism had taken light,
for example, to symbolize the divine (Aes I: 325), and animal worship
was found in the Egyptians (Aes I: 357). But such
actual &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt; had to be distinguished from what was meant to
be symbolized by them, so violence had to be done to such natural
forms in attempts to represent the absolute—such cultural
products thus becoming “bizarre, grotesque, and tasteless”
(Aes I: 77), This, however, undermined their initial function, and the
Greeks were able to offer a dialectical solution to this
contradiction. They gave expression to the Absolute or
the Idea by taking as its material the
specifically &lt;em&gt;human form&lt;/em&gt;, but only on condition of its being
rendered “exempt from all the deficiency of the purely sensuous
and from the contingent finitude of the phenomenal world”. But
even as idealized in Greek sculpture, say, the represented Greek god
is still an object of “naïve intuition and sensuous
imagination” (Aes I: 77–8), and as such the classical gods
contained the germ of their own decline as they could not evade&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;the finitudes incidental to anthropomorphism
[which] pervert the gods into the reverse of what constitutes the
essence of the substantial and Divine (Aes I: 502–4)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A new form of art will be needed to resolve these contradictions, and
this is provided by romantic art. But the &lt;em&gt;material&lt;/em&gt; for this
form will not come from within art itself. While Greek art can be
understood as simultaneously belonging to aesthetic and religious
realms, romantic art results from a fission within the symbolic realm
of what in the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt; Hegel had treated as a single
category, Art-Religion. The transition from classical art to romantic
art represents both a liberation of art from religion and of religion
from art and the sensuous. Thus Christianity, whose rituals centered
around the myth of God becoming man in the person of Jesus, had
avoided the type of reliance on the beautiful productions of art in
the way that characterized Greek religions. The shift from classical
to romantic art, then, represents a broader shift between a culture
whose final authority was an aesthetic one and a culture in which this
authority was handed over to religion, and thus represents a shift in
the authoritativeness of different cognitive forms. This loss of
ultimate authority is the meaning of Hegel’s often misunderstood
thesis of &lt;em&gt;the death of art&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Religion&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well known that after Hegel’s death in 1831, his
followers soon split into left, centre and right
factions over the issue of religion. A dispute over an
appropriately Hegelian philosophical attitude to religion had been
sparked by the publication in 1835–6 of David
Strauss’s &lt;em&gt;The Life of Jesus Critically
Examined&lt;/em&gt;—the conservative &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; claiming that
Hegelianism reflected Christian orthodoxy, the &lt;em&gt;left&lt;/em&gt; seeing it
as a humanistic doctrine concerning the historical emancipation of
mankind. In fact the implications of Hegel’s philosophy for
religious belief had been contentious since his rise to prominence in
the 1820s. While officially declaring that philosophy and religion had
the same &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;—God—Hegel claimed
that the &lt;em&gt;conceptual&lt;/em&gt; form of philosophy dealt with this
concept in a more developed way than that which was achievable in the
imagistic representational form of religion. Many opponents were
suspicious that the concept of God was emptied of its
proper meaning in the process of Hegel’s philosophical
translations and Hegel was suspected by some of pantheism or
atheism. Ultimately, then, the source of the corrosive effects of
Hegel’s philosophy on religion indeed could appear to be the
insistence that the content of religious belief, like everything else,
be grounded on rational, in fact &lt;em&gt;logical&lt;/em&gt;,
considerations—the logical coherence of the system of philosophy
itself—rather than on anything like revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the writings he had produced in the 1790s Hegel had shown a
clear attraction to the type of folk art-religions of ancient Greece
in contrast to Christianity, whose other-worldly doctrines did not
reflect the kind of &lt;em&gt;Heimatlichkeit&lt;/em&gt; he valued in
the ancient world, and it is common to see Hegel’s later embrace
of the Christianity he described as “the consummate religion” as an
expression of a cultural and political conservatism of his later
years. This under-estimates the complexity of Hegel’s evolving
views on both philosophy and religion, however. The limitations of
Greek &lt;em&gt;at-homeness&lt;/em&gt; in the world had to do with the inability
of Greek life and thought to sustain that dimension of human existence
that is reflected in the category of &lt;em&gt;singularity&lt;/em&gt; of the
subject.  The fate of Socrates had thus represented the ultimate
incompatibility with the Greek form of life itself of the type of
individual, reflective individual who could reflectively
bring &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; belief into question and take a stand against
convention. Similar incompatibilities could be seen reflected in Greek
tragedies such as &lt;em&gt;Antigone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the decline of the Greek world and the rise of the Roman one,
movements such as Stoicism and Christianity would come to give
expression to an individual point of view, but under the social
conditions of Rome or the Middle Ages such a subjective point of view
could only be an alienated one attracted to what, in contrast to Greek
concreteness, would be seen as abstractions. Prior to the modern world
there would be no &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; place in either everyday life or in
philosophical culture for any &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-alienated versions of the
reflective or subjective position that had first emerged with
Socrates—no form of life in which this individual dimension of
human subjectivity &lt;em&gt;could be&lt;/em&gt; at home. But
Christianity marked a type of advance over Stoicism in that its
doctrines of the nature of a good life had a this
worldly &lt;em&gt;exemplar&lt;/em&gt;. Thus in describing the doctrine of the
Stoic sage, Hegel seemed fond of quoting Cicero’s dictum
that &lt;em&gt;nobody can say who this sage is&lt;/em&gt; (LHP II: 250–1,
256). It was the abstractness of the Stoic’s conception of the
good man that was answered by the new religious cult centred on the
life of the historical Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense Christianity marked a definite advance over the more
intuitively based religious cults to which Hegel had been attracted in
his youth, but it would only be in the modern world that the content
of the core ideas of Christianity could be given proper
expression. Thus Hegel treats medieval Catholicism as still caught in
the abstractions of a transcendent realm and as caught up in a type of
literal reading of this
religion’s &lt;em&gt;Vorstellungen&lt;/em&gt;—its
pictures. These need to become conceptualized, and this
happens under modern Protestantism, and this, for Hegel, requires a
type of demythologization of the religious content
handed down from the past. Christ must somehow come to stand as an
example of the human kind in general, which is the ultimate bearer of
the status of being the &lt;em&gt;son of God&lt;/em&gt;. Once more, it is the
purported &lt;em&gt;singularity&lt;/em&gt; of the category &lt;em&gt;son of God&lt;/em&gt;
that must be brought back into relation to the &lt;em&gt;universality&lt;/em&gt;
of the human &lt;em&gt;genus&lt;/em&gt;. It is the nature of this result that
divided Hegel’s followers into their right and
left camps. The understanding of what Hegel means by the
concept &lt;em&gt;religion&lt;/em&gt; in turn becomes tied to understanding what
he means by &lt;em&gt;philosophy&lt;/em&gt;. Appropriately the &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of
Religion&lt;/em&gt; thus passes over into the final form of &lt;em&gt;Absolute
Spirit&lt;/em&gt;, Philosophy—a science that is the “unity of
Art and Religion” (PM: §572). The mere six paragraphs devoted to this
science in the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia&lt;/em&gt; and dealing almost exclusively
with the relation of philosophy to religion were to be expanded into
the massive posthumously published three volumes on the
(philosophical) history of philosophy based on various sources
including student transcripts for his lecture series given in
Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;History of Philosophy&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hegel’s time, the idea that philosophy &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; a
historical development had only recently come into focus. Both Fichte
and Schelling had discussed the idea of a history of
reason following Kant’s allusion to such a notion in the
closing pages of &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt;, and systematic
approaches to the history of philosophy had emerged like that of
W.G. Tennemann, who presupposed a type of Kantian framework. Clearly
Hegel’s history of philosophy would be a present-centered one,
in which the philosophical narrative would reveal a development up to
the point represented by his own philosophy as &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt;
culmination. It is thus predictably Eurocentric: philosophy
“commences in the West” because the West is where
“this freedom of self-consciousness first comes forth”
(LHP I: 99). There is an important caveat to add here,
however. Philosophy is often identified with the capacity
for &lt;em&gt;abstract&lt;/em&gt; thought, and this is not confined to Europe and
its history. Rather, it is typical of &lt;em&gt;eastern&lt;/em&gt; cultures like
those of India and China. As we have seen in the context
of &lt;em&gt;art&lt;/em&gt;, Hegel identifies Greek culture with a type of
at-homeness in the world—what we might think of as
the &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt; of a tendency to abstraction and its typical
attraction to the &lt;em&gt;transcendent&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;other-worldly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek philosophy, and so &lt;em&gt;philosophy itself&lt;/em&gt;, starts with
Thales and Ionian natural philosophy. When Thales
choses &lt;em&gt;water&lt;/em&gt; as the “the principle and substance of all
that is” (LHP I: 175) he has abstracted the &lt;em&gt;concept&lt;/em&gt;
water from the stuff immediately encountered in puddles and so
on. Subsequent attempts to specify what it is that underlies all
things show influences of eastern abstraction as in
Pythagoras’s numericism, which is static and “destitute of
process or dialectic” (LHP I: 212) but later thinkers such as Zeno and
Heraclitus grasp that which is at the heart of things in more dynamic
ways. This type of dialectical thought which grasps the &lt;em&gt;unity&lt;/em&gt;
of opposites, familiar from the &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology&lt;/em&gt; and
the &lt;em&gt;Logic&lt;/em&gt;, comes to fruition in Plato’s
dialogue &lt;em&gt;Parmenides&lt;/em&gt; (LHP I: 261). What we are witnessing
here, of course, is meant to be a progression that in some sense
mirrors the progression of categories in Hegel’s
own &lt;em&gt;Logic&lt;/em&gt;, but this progression of objective &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;
gets joined to another dynamic with the appearance of Socrates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socrates was more than a philosopher: he was a
“world-historical person”—a “main
turning-point [&lt;em&gt;Hauptwendepunkt&lt;/em&gt;] of spirit on itself”
exhibited itself in his philosophical thought (LHP I: 384). In short,
Socrates had added a &lt;em&gt;subjective dimension&lt;/em&gt; to the otherwise
natural moral lives of Athenian citizens, in that he had
challenged them to find the principles not of worldly things but
of &lt;em&gt;their own actions&lt;/em&gt;, and challenged them to find these
within the resources of &lt;em&gt;their own individual consciousnesses&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In him we see pre-eminently the inwardness of
consciousness that in an anthropological way existed in the first
instance in him and became later on a usual thing. (LHP I: 391)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With this we see “moral substance [&lt;em&gt;Sittlichkeit&lt;/em&gt;] turn
into reflective morality [&lt;em&gt;Moralität&lt;/em&gt;]” and
“the reflection of consciousness into itself”. “The
spirit of the world here begins to turn, a turn that was later carried
to its completion” (LHP I: 407). This completion would be only
achieved in modernity because, as we have seen, Socrates’s
challenging of convention in terms of resources taken from individual
consciousness itself was incompatible with the immediacy of
Greek &lt;em&gt;Sittlichkeit&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plato and, especially Aristotle, represent the pinnacle of ancient
philosophy, but this philosophy, no matter how great,
represents &lt;em&gt;its time&lt;/em&gt;, that is, the time of the Greek form of
spirit, raised to the level of thought. Neither Plato nor Aristotle
can break free in thought from the contradiction between the
conception of autonomous subjectivity represented by Socrates and the
essential collectivity of Greek culture. Classical Greek philosophy
will succumb in the same way that the Greek polis succumbs to its own
internal contradictions, and what will eventually replace it will be a
type of philosophizing constrained within the doctrinal constraints of
the new religion, Christianity. But Christianity, as we have seen,
gives representation to a solution to the problem of subjectivity
encountered in the form of Socrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philosophy proper only thrives under conditions of
at-homeness in the world and such conditions obtained in
neither the Roman nor medieval world. Hegel then sees both periods of
philosophy as effectively marking time, and it is only in the modern
world that once more develops. What modern philosophy will reflect is
the universalization of the type of subjectivity we have seen
represented by Socrates in the Greek polis and Jesus in the Christian
religious community. Strangely, Hegel nominates two very antithetic
figures as marking the onset of modern philosophy, Francis Bacon and
the German Christian mystic, Jacob Böhme (LHP III:
170–216).  In the 1825–6 lectures, from there Hegel traces
the path of modern philosophy through three phases: a first
period of metaphysics comprising Descartes, Spinoza and
Malebranche; a second treating Locke, Leibniz and others; and the
&lt;em&gt;recent&lt;/em&gt; philosophies of Kant, Fichte, Jacobi and
Schelling. Of course the perspective from which this narrative has
been written is the absent &lt;em&gt;final&lt;/em&gt; stage within this
sequence—that represented by Hegel himself.  Hegel concludes the
lectures with the claim that he has&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;tried to exhibit their (this series of
spiritual configurations) necessary procession out of one
another, so that each philosophy necessarily presupposes the one
preceding it. Our standpoint is the cognition of spirit, the knowledge
of the idea as spirit, as absolute spirit, which as absolute opposes
itself to another spirit, to the finite spirit. To recognize that
absolute spirit can be &lt;em&gt;for it&lt;/em&gt; is this finite spirit’s
principle and vocation. (LHP 1825–6, III: 212)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="LifeWrit"&gt;1. Life and Writings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EarlYear"&gt;1.1 Early Years&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Karl Marx was born in 1818, one of nine children. The family lived in
the Rhineland region of Prussia, previously under French rule. Both of
his parents came from Jewish families with distinguished rabbinical
lineages. Marx’s father was a lawyer who converted to
Christianity when it became necessary for him to do so if he was to
continue his legal career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Following an unexceptional school career, Marx studied law and
philosophy at the universities of Bonn and Berlin. His doctoral thesis
was in ancient philosophy, comparing the philosophies of nature of
Democritus (c.460–370 BCE) and Epicurus (341–270 BCE).
From early 1842, he embarked on a career as a radical journalist,
contributing to, and then editing, the &lt;em&gt;Rheinische Zeitung&lt;/em&gt;,
until the paper was closed by the Prussian authorities in April
1843.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx married Jenny von Westphalen (1814–1881), his childhood
sweetheart, in June 1843. They would spend their lives together and
have seven children, of whom just three daughters—Jenny
(1844–1883), Laura (1845–1911), and Eleanor
(1855–1898)—survived to adulthood. Marx is also widely
thought to have fathered a child—Frederick Demuth
(1851–1929)—with Helene Demuth (1820–1890),
housekeeper and friend of the Marx family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx’s adult life combined independent scholarship, political
activity, and financial insecurity, in fluctuating proportions.
Political conditions were such, that, in order to associate and write
as he wished, he had to live outside of Germany for most of this time.
Marx spent three successive periods of exile in the capital cities of
France, Belgium, and England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Pari"&gt;1.2 Paris&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Between late 1843 and early 1845, Marx lived in Paris, a cosmopolitan
city full of émigrés and radical artisans. He was
subsequently expelled by the French government following Prussian
pressure. In his last months in Germany and during this Paris exile,
Marx produced a series of “early writings”, many not
intended for publication, which significantly altered interpretations
of his thought when they were published collectively in the twentieth
century. Papers that actually saw publication during this period
include: “On the Jewish Question” (1843) in which Marx
defends Jewish Emancipation against Bruno Bauer (1809–1882), but
also emphasises the limitations of “political” as against
“human” emancipation; and the “Critique of
Hegel’s Philosophy of Right: Introduction” (1844) which
contains a critical account of religion, together with some prescient
remarks about the emancipatory potential of the proletariat. The most
significant works that Marx wrote for self-clarification rather than
publication in his Paris years are the so-called “1844
Manuscripts” (1844) which provide a suggestive account of
alienation, especially of alienation in work; and the “Theses on
Feuerbach” (1845), a set of epigrammatic but rich remarks
including reflections on the nature of philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Brus"&gt;1.3 Brussels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Between early 1845 and early 1848, Marx lived in Brussels, the capital
of a rapidly industrialising Belgium. A condition of his residency was
to refrain from publishing on contemporary politics, and he was
eventually expelled after political demonstrations involving foreign
nationals took place. In Brussels Marx published &lt;em&gt;The Holy
Family&lt;/em&gt; (1845), which includes contributions from his new friend
and close collaborator Friedrich Engels (1820–1895), continuing
the attack on Bruno Bauer and his followers. Marx also worked, with
Engels, on a series of manuscripts now usually known as &lt;em&gt;The German
Ideology&lt;/em&gt; (1845–46), a substantial section of which
criticises the work of Max Stirner (1806–1856). Marx also wrote
and published &lt;em&gt;The Poverty of Philosophy&lt;/em&gt; (1847) which
disparages the social theory of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon
(1809–1865). All these publications characteristically show Marx
developing and promoting his own views through fierce critical attacks
on contemporaries, often better-known and more established than
himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx was politically active throughout his adult life, although the
events of 1848—during which time he returned to Paris and
Cologne—inspired the first of two periods of especially intense
activity. Two important texts here are &lt;em&gt;The Communist
Manifesto&lt;/em&gt; (1848) which Marx and Engels published just before the
February Revolution, and, following his move to London, &lt;em&gt;The Class
Struggles in France&lt;/em&gt; (1850) in which Marx examined the subsequent
failure of 1848 in France. Between these two dates, Marx commented on,
and intervened in, the revolution in Germany through the &lt;em&gt;Neue
Rheinische Zeitung&lt;/em&gt; (1848–49), the paper he helped to
establish and edit in Cologne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Lond"&gt;1.4 London&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For well over half of his adult life—from late 1849 until his
death in 1883—Marx lived in London, a city providing a secure
haven for political exiles and a superb vantage point from which to
study the world’s most advanced capitalist economy. This third
and longest exile was dominated by an intellectual and personal
struggle to complete his critique of political economy, but his
theoretical output extended far beyond that project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx’s initial attempt to make sense of Napoleon III’s
rise to power in contemporary France is contained in &lt;em&gt;The
Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte&lt;/em&gt; (1852). Between 1852 and
1862 Marx also wrote well over three hundred articles for the &lt;em&gt;New
York Daily Tribune&lt;/em&gt;; sometimes unfairly disparaged as merely
income-generating journalism, they frequently contain illuminating
attempts to explain contemporary European society and politics
(including European interventions in India and China) to an American
audience (helpfully) presumed to know little about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second of Marx’s two especially intense periods of political
activity—after the revolutions of 1848—centred on his
involvement in the International Working Men’s Association
between 1864 and 1874, and the events of the Paris Commune (1871), in
particular. The character and lessons of the Commune—the
short-lived, and violently suppressed, municipal rebellion that
controlled Paris for several months in the aftermath of the
Franco-Prussian war—are discussed in &lt;em&gt;The Civil War in
France&lt;/em&gt; (1871). Also politically important was Marx’s
“Critique of the Gotha Programme” (1875), in which he
criticises the theoretical influence of Ferdinand Lassalle
(1825–1864) on the German labour movement, and portrays the
higher stage of a future communist society as endorsing distribution
according to “the needs principle”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx’s critique of political economy remains controversial. He
never succeeded in fixing and realising the wider project that he
envisaged. Volume One of &lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1867, was the
only significant part of the project published in his own lifetime,
and even here he was unable to resist heavily reworking subsequent
editions (especially the French version of 1872–75). What we now
know as Volume Two and Volume Three of &lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt; were put
together from Marx’s raw materials by Engels and published in
1885 and 1894, respectively, and Marx’s own drafts were written
before the publication of Volume One and barely touched by him in the
remaining fifteen years of his life. An additional three supplementary
volumes planned by Engels, and subsequently called &lt;em&gt;Theories of
Surplus Value&lt;/em&gt; (or, more colloquially, the “fourth volume of
&lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt;”) were assembled from remaining notes by Karl
Kautsky (1854–1938), and published between 1905 and 1910. (The
section of the “new MEGA”—see below—concerned
with &lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt;-related texts contains fifteen thick volumes,
and provides some sense of the extent and character of these later
editorial interventions.) In addition, the publication in 1953—a
previous two-volume edition (1939 and 1941) had only a highly
restricted circulation—of the so-called &lt;em&gt;Grundrisse&lt;/em&gt;
(written in 1857–58) was also important. Whether this text is
treated as a freestanding work or as a preparatory step towards
&lt;em&gt;Capital,&lt;/em&gt; it raises many questions about Marx’s method,
his relation to G.W.F. Hegel (1770–1831), and the evolution of
Marx’s thought. In contrast, the work of political economy that
Marx did publish in this period—&lt;em&gt;A Contribution to a Critique
of Political Economy&lt;/em&gt; (1859)—was largely ignored by both
contemporaries and later commentators, except for the, much reprinted
and discussed, summary sketch of his theory of history that Marx
offered in the so-called “1859 Preface” to that
volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx’s later years (after the Paris Commune) are the subject of
much interpretative disagreement. His inability to deliver the later
volumes of &lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt; is often seen as emblematic of a wider and
more systematic intellectual failure (Stedman Jones 2016). However,
others have stressed Marx’s continued intellectual creativity in
this period, as he variously rethought his views about: the core and
periphery of the international economic system; the scope of his
theory of history; social anthropology; and the economic and political
evolution of Russia (Shanin 1983; K. Anderson 2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After the death of his wife, in 1881, Marx’s life was dominated
by illness, and travel aimed at improving his health (convalescent
destinations including the Isle of Wight, Karlsbad, Jersey, and
Algiers). Marx died in March 1883, two months after the death of his
eldest daughter. His estate was valued at £250.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Engels’s wider role in the evolution of, and, more especially
the reception and interpretation of, Marx’s work is much
disputed. The truth here is complex, and Engels is not always
well-treated in the literature. Marx and Engels are sometimes
portrayed as if they were a single entity, of one mind on all matters,
whose individual views on any topic can be found simply by consulting
the other. Others present Engels as the distorter and manipulator of
Marx’s thought, responsible for any element of Marxian theory
with which the relevant commentator might disagree. Despite their
familiarity, neither caricature seems plausible or fair. The
best-known jointly authored texts are &lt;em&gt;The Holy&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Family&lt;/em&gt;, the “German Ideology” manuscripts, and
&lt;em&gt;The Communist Manifesto&lt;/em&gt;, but there are nearly two hundred
shorter items that they both contributed to (Draper 1985:
2–19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many of Marx’s best-known writings remained unpublished before
his death. The attempt to establish a reliable collected edition has
proved lengthy and fraught. The authoritative
&lt;em&gt;Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe&lt;/em&gt;, the so-called “new
&lt;em&gt;MEGA”&lt;/em&gt; (1975–), is still a work in progress, begun
under Soviet auspices but since 1990 under the guidance of the
“International Marx-Engels Stiftung” (IMES). In its
current form—much scaled-down from its original
ambitions—the edition will contain some 114 volumes (well over a
half of which are published at the time of writing). In addition to
his various published and unpublished works, it includes Marx’s
journalism, correspondence, drafts, and (some) notebooks. Texts are
published in their original language (variously German, English, and
French). For those needing to utilise English-language resources, the
fifty volume &lt;em&gt;Marx Engels Collected Works&lt;/em&gt; (1975–2004)
can be recommended. (References to Marx and Engels quotations here are
to these &lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; volumes.) There are also several useful single
volume selections of Marx and Engels writings in English (including
Marx 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AlieHumaFlou"&gt;2. Alienation and Human Flourishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BasiIdea"&gt;2.1 The Basic Idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alienation is a concept especially, but not uniquely, associated with
Marx’s work, and the intellectual tradition that he helped
found. It identifies a distinct kind of social ill, involving a
separation between a subject and an object that properly belong
together. The subject here is typically an individual or a group,
while the object is usually an “entity” which variously is
not itself a subject, is another subject(s), or is the original
subject (that is, the relation here can be reflexive). And the
relation between the relevant subject and object is one of problematic
separation. Both elements of that characterisation are important. Not
all social ills, of course, involve separations; for instance, being
overly integrated into some object might be dysfunctional, but it is
not characteristic of alienation. Moreover, not all separations are
problematic, and accounts of alienation typically appeal to some
baseline unity or harmony that is frustrated or violated by the
separation in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Theories of alienation vary considerably, but frequently: first,
identify a subset of these problematic separations as being of
particular importance; second, include an account (sometimes implicit)
of what makes the relevant separations problematic; and, third,
propound some explanatory claims about the extent of, and prognosis
for, alienation, so understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ReliWork"&gt;2.2 Religion and Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx’s ideas concerning alienation were greatly influenced by
the critical writings on religion of Ludwig Feuerbach
(1804–1872), and especially his &lt;em&gt;The Essence of
Christianity&lt;/em&gt; (1841). One key text in this respect is Marx’s
“Contribution of Hegel’s Critique of Right:
Introduction” (1843). This work is home to Marx’s
notorious remark that religion is the “opium of the
people,” a harmful, illusion-generating painkiller
(&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 3: 175). It is here that Marx sets out his account of
religion in most detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While traditional Christian theology asserts that God created man in
God’s own image, Marx fully accepted Feuerbach’s inversion
of this picture, proposing that human beings had invented God in their
own image; indeed a view that long pre-dated Feuerbach.
Feuerbach’s distinctive contribution was to argue that
worshipping God diverted human beings from enjoying their own human
powers. In their imagination humans raise their own powers to an
infinite level and project them on to an abstract object. Hence
religion is a form of alienation, for it separates human beings from
their “species essence.” Marx accepted much of
Feuerbach’s account but argues that Feuerbach failed to
understand why people fall into religious alienation, and so is unable
to explain how it can be transcended. Feuerbach’s view appears
to be that belief in religion is purely an intellectual error and can
be corrected by persuasion. Marx’s explanation is that religion
is a response to alienation in material life, and therefore cannot be
removed until human material life is emancipated, at which point
religion will wither away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Precisely what it is about material life that creates religion is not
set out with complete clarity. However, it seems that at least two
aspects of alienation are responsible. One is alienated labour, which
will be explored shortly. A second is the need for human beings to
assert their communal essence. Whether or not we explicitly recognise
it, human beings exist as a community, and what makes human life
possible is our mutual dependence on the vast network of social and
economic relations which engulf us all, even though this is rarely
acknowledged in our day-to-day life. Marx’s view appears to be
that we must, somehow or other, acknowledge our communal existence in
our institutions. At first it is “deviously acknowledged”
by religion, which creates a false idea of a community in which we are
all equal in the eyes of God. After the post-Reformation fragmentation
of religion, where religion is no longer able to play the role even of
a fake community of equals, the modern state fills this need by
offering us the illusion of a community of citizens, all equal in the
eyes of the law. Interestingly, the political or liberal state, which
is needed to manage the politics of religious diversity, takes on the
role offered by religion in earlier times of providing a form of
illusory community. But the political state and religion will both be
transcended when a genuine community of social and economic equals is
created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although Marx was greatly inspired by thinking about religious
alienation, much more of his attention was devoted to exploring
alienation in work. In a much-discussed passage from the &lt;em&gt;1844
Manuscripts&lt;/em&gt;, Marx identifies four dimensions of alienated labour
in contemporary capitalist society (&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 3: 270–282).
First, immediate producers are separated from the product of their
labour; they create a product that they neither own nor control,
indeed, which comes to dominate them. (Note that this idea of
“fetishism”—where human creations escape our
control, achieve the appearance of independence, and come to oppress
us—is not to be equated with alienation as such, but is rather
one form that it can take.) Second, immediate producers are separated
from their productive activity; in particular, they are forced to work
in ways which are mentally and/or physically debilitating. Third,
immediate producers are separated from other individuals; contemporary
economic relations socialise individuals to view others as merely
means to their own particular ends. Fourth, and finally, immediate
producers are separated from their own human nature; for instance, the
human capacities for community and for free, conscious, and creative,
work, are both frustrated by contemporary capitalist relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Note that these claims about alienation are distinct from other,
perhaps more familiar, complaints about work in capitalist society.
For instance, alienated labour, as understood here, could
be—even if it is often not—highly remunerated, limited in
duration, and relatively secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx holds that work has the potential to be something creative and
fulfilling. He consequently rejects the view of work as a necessary
evil, denying that the negative character of work is part of our fate,
a universal fact about the human condition that no amount of social
change could remedy. Indeed, productive activity, on Marx’s
account, is a central element in what it is to be a human being, and
self-realisation through work is a vital component of human
flourishing. That he thinks that work—in a different form of
society—could be creative and fulfilling, perhaps explains the
intensity and scale of Marx’s condemnation of contemporary
economic arrangements and their transformation of workers into
deformed and “dehumanised” beings (&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 3:
284).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was suggested above that alienation consists of dysfunctional
separations—separations between entities that properly belong
together—and that theories of alienation typically presuppose
some baseline condition whose frustration or violation by the relevant
separation identifies the latter as dysfunctional. For Marx, that
baseline seems to be provided by an account of human flourishing,
which he conceptualises in terms of self-realisation (understood here
as the development and deployment of our essential human capacities).
Labour in capitalism, we can say, is alienated because it embodies
separations preventing the self-realisation of producers; because it
is organised in a way that frustrates the human need for free,
conscious, and creative work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So understood, and returning to the four separations said to
characterise alienated labour, we can see that it is the implicit
claim about human nature (the fourth separation) which identifies the
other three separations as dysfunctional. If one subscribed to the
same formal model of alienation and self-realisation, but held a
different account of the substance of human nature, very different
claims about work in capitalist society might result. Imagine a
theorist who held that human beings were solitary, egoistic creatures,
by nature. That theorist could accept that work in capitalist society
encouraged isolation and selfishness, but deny that such results were
alienating, because those results would not frustrate their baseline
account of what it is to be a human being (indeed, they would rather
facilitate those characteristics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AlieCapi"&gt;2.3 Alienation and Capitalism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx seems to hold various views about the historical location and
comparative extent of alienation. These include: that some systematic
forms of alienation—presumably including religious
alienation—existed in pre-capitalist societies; that systematic
forms of alienation—including alienation in work—are only
a feature of class divided societies; that systematic forms of
alienation are greater in contemporary capitalist societies than in
pre-capitalist societies; and that not all human societies are scarred
by class division, in particular, that a future classless society
(communism) will not contain systematic forms of alienation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx maintains that alienation flows from capitalist social relations,
and not from the kind of technological advances that capitalist
society contains. His disapproval of capitalism is reserved for its
social arrangements and not its material accomplishments. He had
little time for what is sometimes called the “romantic critique
of capitalism”, which sees industry and technology as the real
villains, responsible for devastating the purportedly communitarian
idyll of pre-capitalist relations. In contrast, Marx celebrates the
bourgeoisie’s destruction of feudal relations, and sees
technological growth and human liberation as (at least, in time)
progressing hand-in-hand. Industry and technology are understood as
part of the solution to, and not the source of, social problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are many opportunities for scepticism here. In the present
context, many struggle to see how the kind of large-scale industrial
production that would presumably characterise communist
society—communism purportedly being more productive than
capitalism—would avoid alienation in work. Interesting responses
to such concerns have been put forward, but they have typically come
from commentators rather than from Marx himself (Kandiyali 2018). This
is a point at which Marx’s self-denying ordinance concerning the
detailed description of communist society prevents him from engaging
directly with significant concerns about the direction of social
change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PoliEman"&gt;2.4 Political Emancipation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the text “On The Jewish Question” (1843) Marx begins to
make clear the distance between himself and his radical liberal
colleagues among the Young Hegelians; in particular Bruno Bauer. Bauer
had recently written against Jewish emancipation, from an atheist
perspective, arguing that the religion of both Jews and Christians was
a barrier to emancipation. In responding to Bauer, Marx makes one of
the most enduring arguments from his early writings, by means of
introducing a distinction between political
emancipation—essentially the grant of liberal rights and
liberties—and human emancipation. Marx’s reply to Bauer is
that political emancipation is perfectly compatible with the continued
existence of religion, as the contemporary example of the United
States demonstrates. However, pushing matters deeper, in an argument
reinvented by innumerable critics of liberalism, Marx argues that not
only is political emancipation insufficient to bring about human
emancipation, it is in some sense also a barrier. Liberal rights and
ideas of justice are premised on the idea that each of us needs
protection from other human beings who are a threat to our liberty and
security. Therefore, liberal rights are rights of separation, designed
to protect us from such perceived threats. Freedom on such a view, is
freedom from interference. What this view overlooks is the
possibility—for Marx, the fact—that real freedom is to be
found positively in our relations with other people. It is to be found
in human community, not in isolation. Accordingly, insisting on a
regime of liberal rights encourages us to view each other in ways that
undermine the possibility of the real freedom we may find in human
emancipation. Now we should be clear that Marx does not oppose
political emancipation, for he sees that liberalism is a great
improvement on the systems of feudalism and religious prejudice and
discrimination which existed in the Germany of his day. Nevertheless,
such politically emancipated liberalism must be transcended on the
route to genuine human emancipation. Unfortunately, Marx never tells
us what human emancipation is, although it is clear that it is closely
related to the ideas of non-alienated labour and meaningful
community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="RemaQues"&gt;2.5 Remaining Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even with these elaborations, many additional questions remain about
Marx’s account. Three concerns are briefly addressed here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, one might worry about the place of alienation in the evolution
of Marx’s thought. The once-popular suggestion that Marx only
wrote about alienation in his early writings—his published and
unpublished works from the early 1840s—is not sustained by the
textual evidence. However, the theoretical role that the concept of
alienation plays in his writings might still be said to evolve. For
example, it has been suggested that alienation in the early writings
is intended to play an “explanatory role”, whereas in his
later work it comes to have a more “descriptive or
diagnostic” function (Wood 1981 [2004: 7]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A second concern is the role of human nature in the interpretation of
alienation offered here. In one exegetical variant of this worry, the
suggestion is that this account of alienation rests on a model of
universal human nature which Marx’s (later) understanding of
historical specificity and change prevents him from endorsing.
However, there is much evidence against this purported later rejection
of human nature (see Geras 1983). Indeed, the “mature”
Marx explicitly affirms that human nature has both constant and
mutable elements; that human beings are characterised by universal
qualities, constant across history and culture, and variable
qualities, reflecting historical and cultural diversity (McMurtry
1978: 19–53). One systematic, rather than exegetical, variant of
the present worry suggests that we should not endorse accounts of
alienation which depend on “thick” and inevitably
controversial accounts of human nature (Jaeggi 2016). Whatever view we
take of that claim about our endorsement, there seems little doubt
about the “thickness” of Marx’s own account of human
flourishing. To provide for the latter, a society must satisfy not
only basic needs (for sustenance, warmth and shelter, certain climatic
conditions, physical exercise, basic hygiene, procreation and sexual
activity), but also less basic needs, both those that are not always
appreciated to be part of his account (for recreation, culture,
intellectual stimulation, artistic expression, emotional satisfaction,
and aesthetic pleasure), and those that Marx is more often associated
with (for fulfilling work and meaningful community) (Leopold 2007:
227–245).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Third, we may ask about Marx’s attitude towards the distinction
sometimes made between subjective and objective alienation. These two
forms of alienation can be exemplified separately or conjointly in the
lives of particular individuals or societies (Hardimon 1994:
119–122). Alienation is “subjective” when it is
characterised in terms of the presence (or absence) of certain beliefs
or feelings; for example, when individuals are said to be alienated
because they feel estranged from the world. Alienation is
“objective” when it is characterised in terms which make
no reference to the beliefs or feelings of individuals; for example,
when individuals are said to be alienated because they fail to develop
and deploy their essential human characteristics, whether or not they
experience that lack of self-realisation as a loss. Marx seems to
allow that these two forms of alienation are conceptually distinct,
but assumes that in capitalist societies they are typically found
together. Indeed, he often appears to think of subjective alienation
as tracking the objective variant. That said, Marx does allow that
they can come apart sociologically. At least, that is one way of
reading a passage in &lt;em&gt;The Holy Family&lt;/em&gt; where he recognises that
capitalists do not get to engage in self-realising activities of the
right kind (and hence are objectively alienated), but
that—unlike the proletariat—they are &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; in
their estrangement (and hence are lacking subjective alienation),
feeling “at ease” in, and even “strengthened”
by, it (&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 4: 36).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TheoHist"&gt;3. Theory of History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Sour"&gt;3.1 Sources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx did not set out his theory of history in great detail.
Accordingly, it has to be constructed from a variety of texts, both
those where he attempts to apply a theoretical analysis to past and
future historical events, and those of a more purely theoretical
nature. Of the latter, the “1859 Preface” to &lt;em&gt;A
Critique of Political Economy&lt;/em&gt; has achieved canonical status.
However, the manuscripts collected together as &lt;em&gt;The German
Ideology&lt;/em&gt;, co-written with Engels in 1845-46, are also a much used
early source. We shall briefly outline both texts, and then look at
the reconstruction of Marx’s theory of history in the hands of
his philosophically most influential recent exponent, G.A. Cohen
(Cohen 1978 [2001], 1988), who builds on the interpretation of the
early Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov (1856–1918)
(Plekhanov 1895 [1947]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We should, however, be aware that Cohen’s interpretation is far
from universally accepted. Cohen provided his reconstruction of Marx
partly because he was frustrated with existing Hegelian-inspired
“dialectical” interpretations of Marx, and what he
considered to be the vagueness of the influential works of Louis
Althusser (1918–1990), neither of which, he felt, provided a
rigorous account of Marx’s views. However, some scholars believe
that the interpretation that we shall focus on is faulty precisely for
its insistence on a mechanical model and its lack of attention to the
dialectic. One aspect of this criticism is that Cohen’s
understanding has a surprisingly small role for the concept of class
struggle, which is often felt to be central to Marx’s theory of
history. Cohen’s explanation for this is that the “1859
Preface”, on which his interpretation is based, does not give a
prominent role to class struggle, and indeed it is not explicitly
mentioned. Yet this reasoning is problematic for it is possible that
Marx did not want to write in a manner that would engage the concerns
of the police censor, and, indeed, a reader aware of the context may
be able to detect an implicit reference to class struggle through the
inclusion of such phrases as “then begins an era of social
revolution,” and “the ideological forms in which men
become conscious of this conflict and fight it out”. Hence it
does not follow that Marx himself thought that the concept of class
struggle was relatively unimportant. Furthermore, when &lt;em&gt;A Critique
of Political Economy&lt;/em&gt; was replaced by &lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt;, Marx made
no attempt to keep the &lt;em&gt;1859 Preface&lt;/em&gt; in print, and its content
is reproduced just as a very much abridged footnote in
&lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt;. Nevertheless, we shall concentrate here on
Cohen’s interpretation as no other account has been set out with
comparable rigour, precision and detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EarlForm"&gt;3.2 Early Formulations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In his “&lt;em&gt;Theses on Feuerbach&lt;/em&gt;” (1845) Marx provides
a background to what would become his theory of history by stating his
objections to “all hitherto existing” materialism and
idealism, understood as types of philosophical theories. Materialism
is complimented for understanding the physical reality of the world,
but is criticised for ignoring the active role of the human subject in
creating the world we perceive. Idealism, at least as developed by
Hegel, understands the active nature of the human subject, but
confines it to thought or contemplation: the world is created through
the categories we impose upon it. Marx combines the insights of both
traditions to propose a view in which human beings do indeed create
—or at least transform—the world they find themselves in,
but this transformation happens not in thought but through actual
material activity; not through the imposition of sublime concepts but
through the sweat of their brow, with picks and shovels. This
historical version of materialism, which, according to Marx,
transcends and thus rejects all existing philosophical thought, is the
foundation of Marx’s later theory of history. As Marx puts it in
the “1844 Manuscripts”, “Industry is the actual
historical relationship of nature … to man”
(&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 3: 303). This thought, derived from reflection on the
history of philosophy, together with his experience of social and
economic realities, as a journalist, sets the agenda for all
Marx’s future work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;em&gt;The German Ideology&lt;/em&gt; manuscripts, Marx and Engels contrast
their new materialist method with the idealism that had characterised
previous German thought. Accordingly, they take pains to set out the
“premises of the materialist method”. They start, they
say, from “real human beings”, emphasising that human
beings are essentially productive, in that they must produce their
means of subsistence in order to satisfy their material needs. The
satisfaction of needs engenders new needs of both a material and
social kind, and forms of society arise corresponding to the state of
development of human productive forces. Material life determines, or
at least “conditions” social life, and so the primary
direction of social explanation is from material production to social
forms, and thence to forms of consciousness. As the material means of
production develop, “modes of co-operation” or economic
structures rise and fall, and eventually communism will become a real
possibility once the plight of the workers and their awareness of an
alternative motivates them sufficiently to become revolutionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N185Pref"&gt;3.3 1859 Preface&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the sketch of &lt;em&gt;The German Ideology&lt;/em&gt;, many of the key
elements of historical materialism are present, even if the
terminology is not yet that of Marx’s more mature writings.
Marx’s statement in the “1859 Preface” renders
something of the same view in sharper form. Cohen’s
reconstruction of Marx’s view in the Preface begins from what
Cohen calls the Development Thesis, which is pre-supposed, rather than
explicitly stated in the Preface (Cohen 1978 [2001]: 134–174).
This is the thesis that the productive forces tend to develop, in the
sense of becoming more powerful, over time. The productive forces are
the means of production, together with productively applicable
knowledge: technology, in other words. The development thesis states
not that the productive forces always do develop, but that there is a
tendency for them to do so. The next thesis is the primacy thesis,
which has two aspects. The first states that the nature of a
society’s economic structure is explained by the level of
development of its productive forces, and the second that the nature
of the superstructure—the political and legal institutions of
society—is explained by the nature of the economic structure.
The nature of a society’s ideology, which is to say certain
religious, artistic, moral and philosophical beliefs contained within
society, is also explained in terms of its economic structure,
although this receives less emphasis in Cohen’s interpretation.
Indeed, many activities may well combine aspects of both the
superstructure and ideology: a religion is constituted by both
institutions and a set of beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Revolution and epoch change is understood as the consequence of an
economic structure no longer being able to continue to develop the
forces of production. At this point the development of the productive
forces is said to be fettered, and, according to the theory, once an
economic structure fetters development it will be
revolutionised—“burst asunder” (&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 6:
489)—and eventually replaced with an economic structure better
suited to preside over the continued development of the forces of
production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In outline, then, the theory has a pleasing simplicity and power. It
seems plausible that human productive power develops over time, and
plausible too that economic structures exist for as long as they
develop the productive forces, but will be replaced when they are no
longer capable of doing this. Yet severe problems emerge when we
attempt to put more flesh on these bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FuncExpl"&gt;3.4 Functional Explanation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Prior to Cohen’s work, historical materialism had not been
regarded as a coherent view within English-language political
philosophy. The antipathy is well summed up with the closing words of
H.B. Acton’s &lt;em&gt;The Illusion of the Epoch&lt;/em&gt;: “Marxism
is a philosophical farrago” (1955: 271). One difficulty taken
particularly seriously by Cohen is an alleged inconsistency between
the explanatory primacy of the forces of production, and certain
claims made elsewhere by Marx which appear to give the economic
structure primacy in explaining the development of the productive
forces. For example, in &lt;em&gt;The Communist Manifesto&lt;/em&gt; Marx and
Engels state that: “The bourgeoisie cannot exist without
constantly revolutionising the instruments of production”
(&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 6: 487). This appears to give causal and explanatory
primacy to the economic structure—capitalism—which brings
about the development of the forces of production. Cohen accepts that,
on the surface at least, this generates a contradiction. Both the
economic structure and the development of the productive forces seem
to have explanatory priority over each other. Unsatisfied by such
vague resolutions as “determination in the last instance”,
or the idea of “dialectical” connections, Cohen
self-consciously attempts to apply the standards of clarity and rigour
of analytic philosophy to provide a reconstructed version of
historical materialism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The key theoretical innovation is to appeal to the notion of
functional explanation, also sometimes called “consequence
explanation” (Cohen 1978 [2001]: 249–296). The
essential move is cheerfully to admit that the economic structure,
such as capitalism, does indeed develop the productive forces, but to
add that this, according to the theory, is precisely why we have
capitalism (when we do). That is, if capitalism failed to develop the
productive forces it would disappear. And, indeed, this fits
beautifully with historical materialism. For Marx asserts that when an
economic structure fails to develop the productive forces—when
it “fetters” the productive forces—it will be
revolutionised and the epoch will change. So the idea of
“fettering” becomes the counterpart to the theory of
functional explanation. Essentially fettering is what happens when the
economic structure becomes dysfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now it is apparent that this renders historical materialism
consistent. Yet there is a question as to whether it is at too high a
price. For we must ask whether functional explanation is a coherent
methodological device. The problem is that we can ask what it is that
makes it the case that an economic structure will only persist for as
long as it develops the productive forces. Jon Elster has pressed this
criticism against Cohen very hard (Elster 1985: 27–35). If we were
to argue that there is an agent guiding history who has the purpose
that the productive forces should be developed as much as possible
then it would make sense that such an agent would intervene in history
to carry out this purpose by selecting the economic structures which
do the best job. However, it is clear that Marx makes no such
metaphysical assumptions. Elster is very critical—sometimes of
Marx, sometimes of Cohen—of the idea of appealing to
“purposes” in history without those being the purposes of
anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Indeed Elster’s criticism was anticipated in fascinating terms
by Simone Weil (1909–1943), who links Marx’s appeal to
history’s purposes to the influence of Hegel on his thought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We must remember the Hegelian origins of Marxist thought. Hegel
believed in a hidden mind at work in the universe, and that the
history of the world is simply the history of this world mind, which,
as in the case of everything spiritual, tends indefinitely towards
perfection. Marx claimed to “put back on its feet” the
Hegelian dialectic, which he accused of being “upside
down”, by substituting matter for mind as the motive power of
history; but by an extraordinary paradox, he conceived history,
starting from this rectification, as though he attributed to matter
what is the very essence of mind—an unceasing aspiration towards
the best. (Weil 1955 [1958: 43])&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cohen is well aware of the difficulty of appealing to purposes in
history, but defends the use of functional explanation by comparing
its use in historical materialism with its use in evolutionary
biology. In contemporary biology it is commonplace to explain the
existence of the stripes of a tiger, or the hollow bones of a bird, by
pointing to the function of these features. Here we have apparent
purposes which are not the purposes of anyone. The obvious counter,
however, is that in evolutionary biology we can provide a causal story
to underpin these functional explanations; a story involving chance
variation and survival of the fittest. Therefore these functional
explanations are sustained by a complex causal feedback loop in which
dysfunctional elements tend to be filtered out in competition with
better functioning elements. Cohen calls such background accounts
“elaborations” and he concedes that functional
explanations are in need of elaborations. But he points out that
standard causal explanations are equally in need of elaborations. We
might, for example, be satisfied with the explanation that the vase
broke because it was dropped on the floor, but a great deal of further
information is needed to explain why this explanation works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Consequently, Cohen claims that we can be justified in offering a
functional explanation even when we are in ignorance of its
elaboration. Indeed, even in biology detailed causal elaborations of
functional explanations have been available only relatively recently.
Prior to Charles Darwin (1809–1882), or arguably Jean-Baptiste
Lamarck (1744–1829), the only candidate causal elaboration was
to appeal to God’s purposes. Darwin outlined a very plausible
mechanism, but having no genetic theory was not able to elaborate it
into a detailed account. Our knowledge remains incomplete in some
respects to this day. Nevertheless, it seems perfectly reasonable to
say that birds have hollow bones in order to facilitate flight.
Cohen’s point is that the weight of evidence that organisms are
adapted to their environment would permit even a pre-Darwinian atheist
to assert this functional explanation with justification. Hence one
can be justified in offering a functional explanation even in the
absence of a candidate elaboration: if there is sufficient weight of
inductive evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At this point the issue, then, divides into a theoretical question and
an empirical one. The empirical question is whether or not there is
evidence that forms of society exist only for as long as they advance
productive power, and are replaced by revolution when they fail. Here,
one must admit, the empirical record is patchy at best, and there
appear to have been long periods of stagnation, even regression, when
dysfunctional economic structures were not revolutionised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The theoretical issue is whether a plausible elaborating explanation
is available to underpin Marxist functional explanations. Here there
is something of a dilemma. In the first instance it is tempting to try
to mimic the elaboration given in the Darwinian story, and appeal to
chance variations and survival of the fittest. In this case
“fittest” would mean “most able to preside over the
development of the productive forces”. Chance variation would be
a matter of people trying out new types of economic relations. On this
account new economic structures begin through experiment, but thrive
and persist through their success in developing the productive forces.
However the problem is that such an account would seem to introduce a
larger element of contingency than Marx seeks, for it is essential to
Marx’s thought that one should be able to predict the eventual
arrival of communism. Within Darwinian theory there is no warrant for
long-term predictions, for everything depends on the contingencies of
particular situations. A similar heavy element of contingency would be
inherited by a form of historical materialism developed by analogy
with evolutionary biology. The dilemma, then, is that the best model
for developing the theory makes predictions based on the theory
unsound, yet the whole point of the theory is predictive. Hence one
must either look for an alternative means of producing elaborating
explanation, or give up the predictive ambitions of the theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Rati"&gt;3.5 Rationality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The driving force of history, in Cohen’s reconstruction of Marx,
is the development of the productive forces, the most important of
which is technology. But what is it that drives such development?
Ultimately, in Cohen’s account, it is human rationality. Human
beings have the ingenuity to apply themselves to develop means to
address the scarcity they find. This on the face of it seems very
reasonable. Yet there are difficulties. As Cohen himself acknowledges,
societies do not always do what would be rational for an individual to
do. Co-ordination problems may stand in our way, and there may be
structural barriers. Furthermore, it is relatively rare for those who
introduce new technologies to be motivated by the need to address
scarcity. Rather, under capitalism, the profit motive is the key. Of
course it might be argued that this is the social form that the
material need to address scarcity takes under capitalism. But still
one may raise the question whether the need to address scarcity always
has the influence that it appears to have taken on in modern times.
For example, a ruling class’s absolute determination to hold on
to power may have led to economically stagnant societies.
Alternatively, it might be thought that a society may put religion or
the protection of traditional ways of life ahead of economic needs.
This goes to the heart of Marx’s theory that man is an
essentially productive being and that the locus of interaction with
the world is industry. As Cohen himself later argued in essays such as
“Reconsidering Historical Materialism” (1988), the
emphasis on production may appear one-sided, and ignore other powerful
elements in human nature. Such a criticism chimes with a criticism
from the previous section; that the historical record may not, in
fact, display the tendency to growth in the productive forces assumed
by the theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AlteInte"&gt;3.6 Alternative Interpretations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many defenders of Marx will argue that the problems stated are
problems for Cohen’s interpretation of Marx, rather than for
Marx himself. It is possible to argue, for example, that Marx did not
have a general theory of history, but rather was a social scientist
observing and encouraging the transformation of capitalism into
communism as a singular event. And it is certainly true that when Marx
analyses a particular historical episode, as he does in the &lt;em&gt;18th
Brumaire of Louis Napoleon&lt;/em&gt; (1852), any idea of fitting events
into a fixed pattern of history seems very far from Marx’s mind.
On other views Marx did have a general theory of history but it is far
more flexible and less determinate than Cohen insists (Miller 1984).
And finally, as noted, there are critics who believe that
Cohen’s interpretation is entirely wrong-headed owing to its
dismissive attitude to dialectical reasoning (Sayers 1984 [1990]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Econ"&gt;4. Economics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ReadCapi"&gt;4.1 Reading &lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How to read Marx’s economic writings, and especially his
masterpiece &lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt; Volume 1,  remains a matter of
controversy. An orthodox reading is that Marx’s essential task
is to contribute to economic theory, based on a modified form of the
labour theory of value. Others warn against such a narrow
interpretation, pointing out that the character of Marx’s
writing and presentation is very far from what one would expect in a
standard economic text. Hence William Clare Roberts (2017), for
example, argues that &lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt; Volume 1 is fundamentally a work
of political theory, rather than economics. Be that as it may,
nevertheless, the work does contain substantial presentation of an
economic analysis of capitalism, and it is on this that we will focus
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="LaboTheoValu"&gt;4.2 Labour Theory of Value&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt; Volume 1 begins with an analysis of the idea of
commodity production. A commodity is defined as a useful external
object, produced for exchange on a market. Thus, two necessary
conditions for commodity production are: the existence of a market, in
which exchange can take place; and a social division of labour, in
which different people produce different products, without which there
would be no motivation for exchange. Marx suggests that commodities
have both use-value—a use, in other words—and an
exchange-value—initially to be understood as their price. Use
value can easily be understood, so Marx says, but he insists that
exchange value is a puzzling phenomenon, and relative exchange values
need to be explained. Why does a quantity of one commodity exchange
for a given quantity of another commodity? His explanation is in terms
of the labour input required to produce the commodity, or rather, the
socially necessary labour, which is labour exerted at the average
level of intensity and productivity for that branch of activity within
the economy. Thus the labour theory of value asserts that the value of
a commodity is determined by the quantity of socially necessary labour
time required to produce it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx provides a two-stage argument for the labour theory of value. The
first stage is to argue that if two objects can be compared in the
sense of being put on either side of an equals sign, then there must
be a “third thing of identical magnitude in both of them”
to which they are both reducible. As commodities can be exchanged
against each other, there must, Marx argues, be a third thing that
they have in common. This then motivates the second stage, which is a
search for the appropriate “third thing”, which is labour
in Marx’s view, as the only plausible common element. Both steps
of the argument are, of course, highly contestable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Capitalism can be distinguished from other forms of commodity
exchange, Marx argues, in that it involves not merely the exchange of
commodities, but the advancement of capital, in the form of money,
with the purpose of generating profit through the purchase of
commodities and their transformation into other commodities which can
command a higher price, and thus yield a profit. Marx claims that no
previous theorist has been able adequately to explain how capitalism
as a whole can make a profit. Marx’s own solution relies on the
idea of exploitation of the worker. In setting up conditions of
production the capitalist purchases the worker’s labour
power—his or her ability to labour—for the day. The cost
of this commodity is determined in the same way as the cost of every
other; that is, in terms of the amount of socially necessary labour
power required to produce it. In this case the value of a day’s
labour power is the value of the commodities necessary to keep the
worker alive for a day. Suppose that such commodities take four hours
to produce. Accordingly the first four hours of the working day is
spent on producing value equivalent to the value of the wages the
worker will be paid. This is known as necessary labour. Any work the
worker does above this is known as surplus labour, producing surplus
value for the capitalist. Surplus value, according to Marx, is the
source of all profit. In Marx’s analysis labour power is the
only commodity which can produce more value than it is worth, and for
this reason it is known as variable capital. Other commodities simply
pass their value on to the finished commodities, but do not create any
extra value. They are known as constant capital. Profit, then, is the
result of the labour performed by the worker beyond that necessary to
create the value of his or her wages. This is the surplus value theory
of profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It appears to follow from this analysis that as industry becomes more
mechanised, using more constant capital and less variable capital, the
rate of profit ought to fall. For as a proportion less capital will be
advanced on labour, and only labour can create value. In
&lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt; Volume 3 Marx does indeed make the prediction that
the rate of profit will fall over time, and this is one of the factors
which leads to the downfall of capitalism. (However, as pointed out by
Paul Sweezy in &lt;em&gt;The Theory of Capitalist Development&lt;/em&gt; (1942),
the analysis is problematic.) A further consequence of this analysis
is a difficulty for the theory that Marx did recognise, and tried,
albeit unsuccessfully, to meet also in the manuscripts that make up
&lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt; Volume 3. It follows from the analysis so far that
labour-intensive industries ought to have a higher rate of profit than
those which use less labour. Not only is this empirically false, it is
theoretically unacceptable. Accordingly, Marx argued that in real
economic life prices vary in a systematic way from values. Providing
the mathematics to explain this is known as the transformation
problem, and Marx’s own attempt suffers from technical
difficulties. Although there are sophisticated known techniques for
solving this problem now there is a question about the degree to which
they do rescue Marx’s project. If it is thought that the labour
theory of value was initially motivated as an intuitively plausible
theory of price then when the connection between price and value is
rendered as indirect as it is in the final theory, the intuitive
motivation of the theory drains away. Others consider this to be a
superficial reading of Marx, and that his general approach allows us
to see through the appearances of capitalism to understand its
underlying basis, which need not coincide with appearances. How
Marx’s theory of capitalism should be read remains an active
area of scholarly debate (Heinrich 2012).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A further objection is that Marx’s assertion that only labour
can create surplus value is unsupported by any argument or analysis,
and can be argued to be merely an artefact of the nature of his
presentation. Any commodity can be picked to play a similar role.
Consequently, with equal justification one could set out a corn theory
of value, arguing that corn has the unique power of creating more
value than it costs. Formally this would be identical to the labour
theory of value (Roemer 1982). Nevertheless, the claims that somehow
labour is responsible for the creation of value, and that profit is
the consequence of exploitation, remain intuitively powerful, even if
they are difficult to establish in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, even if the labour theory of value is considered discredited,
there are elements of his theory that remain of worth. The Cambridge
economist Joan Robinson, in &lt;em&gt;An Essay on Marxian Economics&lt;/em&gt;
(1942), picked out two aspects of particular note. First, Marx’s
refusal to accept that capitalism involves a harmony of interests
between worker and capitalist, replacing this with a class-based
analysis of the worker’s struggle for better wages and
conditions of work, versus the capitalist’s drive for ever
greater profits. Second, Marx’s denial that there is any
long-run tendency to equilibrium in the market, and his descriptions
of mechanisms which underlie the trade-cycle of boom and bust. Both
provide a salutary corrective to aspects of orthodox economic
theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Expl"&gt;4.3 Exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As noted, traditionally Marx’s definition of exploitation is
given in terms of the theory of surplus value, which in turn is taken
to depend on the labour theory of value: the theory that the value of
any commodity is proportional to the amount of “socially
necessary” labour embodied in it. However, the question arises
of whether the basic idea of exploitation should be so dependent on a
particular theory of value. For if it is, the notion of exploitation
becomes vulnerable to Robert Nozick’s objection: that if the
labour theory of value can be shown to be faulty, the Marxist theory
of exploitation collapses too (Nozick 1974).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Others have felt that it is possible to restore the intuitive core of
a Marxist theory of exploitation independent of the labour theory of
value (cf. Cohen 1979, Wolff 1999, Vrousalis 2013). John Roemer, to
take one leading case, states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marxian exploitation is defined as the unequal exchange of labor for
goods: the exchange is unequal when the amount of labor embodied in
the goods which the worker can purchase with his income … is
less than the amount of labor he expended to earn that income.(Roemer
1985: 30)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Suppose I work eight hours to earn my wages. With this perhaps the
best thing I can buy is a coat. But imagine that the coat took only a
total of four hours to make. Therefore I have exchanged my eight hours
work for only four hours of other people’s work, and thereby, on
this view, I am exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The definition requires some refinement. For example, if I am taxed
for the benefit of those unable to work, I will be exploited by the
above definition, but this is not what the definition of exploitation
was intended to capture. Worse still, if there is one person exploited
much more gravely than anyone else in the economy, then it may turn
out that no-one else is exploited. Nevertheless, it should not be
difficult to adjust the definition to take account of these
difficulties, and as noted several other accounts of Marx-inspired
accounts of exploitation have been offered that are independent of the
labour theory of value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many of these alternative definitions add a notion of unfreedom or
domination to unequal exchange of labour and goods (Vrousalis 2013).
The exploited person is forced to accept a situation in which he or
she just never gets back what they put into the labour process. Now
there may be, in particular cases, a great deal to be said about why
this is perfectly acceptable from a moral point of view. However, on
the face of it such exploitation appears to be unjust. Nevertheless,
we will see in the next section why attributing such a position to
Marx himself is fraught with difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Mora"&gt;5. Morality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UnpaIssu"&gt;5.1 Unpacking Issues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The issue of Marx and morality poses a conundrum. On reading
Marx’s works at all periods of his life, there appears to be the
strongest possible distaste towards bourgeois capitalist society, and
an undoubted endorsement of future communist society. Yet the terms of
this antipathy and endorsement are far from clear. Despite
expectations, Marx never directly says that capitalism is unjust.
Neither does he directly say that communism would be a just form of
society. In fact he frequently takes pains to distance himself from
those who engage in a discourse of justice, and makes a conscious
attempt to exclude direct moral commentary in his own works. The
puzzle is why this should be, given the weight of indirect moral
commentary one also finds in his writings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are, initially, separate questions concerning Marx’s
attitude to capitalism and to communism. There are also separate
questions concerning his attitude to ideas of justice, and to ideas of
morality more broadly concerned. This, then, generates four questions:
(a) Did Marx think capitalism unjust?; (b) did he think that
capitalism could be morally criticised on other grounds?; (c) did he
think that communism would be just? (d) did he think it could be
morally approved of on other grounds? These are some of the questions
we consider in this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="InjuCapi"&gt;5.2 The “Injustice” of Capitalism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The initial argument that Marx must have thought that capitalism is
unjust is based on the observation that Marx argued that all
capitalist profit is ultimately derived from the exploitation of the
worker. Capitalism’s dirty secret is that it is not a realm of
harmony and mutual benefit but a system in which one class
systematically extracts profit from another. How could this fail to be
unjust? Yet it is notable that Marx never explicitly draws such a
conclusion, and in &lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt; he goes as far as to say that such
exchange is “by no means an injury to the seller” (MECW
35: 204), which some commentators have taken as evidence that Marx did
not think that capitalism was unjust, although other readings are
possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Allen Wood (1972) is perhaps the leading advocate of the view that
Marx did not believe that capitalism is unjust. Wood argues that Marx
takes this approach because his general theoretical approach excludes
any trans-epochal standpoint from which one can comment on the justice
of an economic system. Even though it is acceptable to criticise
particular behaviour from within an economic structure as unjust (and
theft under capitalism would be an example) it is not possible to
criticise capitalism as a whole. This is a consequence of Marx’s
analysis of the role of ideas of justice from within historical
materialism. Marx claims that juridical institutions are part of the
superstructure, and that ideas of justice are
ideological. Accordingly, the role of both the superstructure and
ideology, in the functionalist reading of historical materialism
adopted here, is to stabilise the economic structure. Consequently, to
state that something is just under capitalism is simply a judgement
that it will tend to have the effect of advancing capitalism.
According to Marx, in any society the ruling ideas are those of the
ruling class; the core of the theory of ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ziyad Husami (1978) however, argues that Wood is mistaken,
ignoring the fact that for Marx ideas undergo a double determination.
We need to differentiate not just by economic system, but also by
economic class within the system. Therefore the ideas of the
non-ruling class may be very different from those of the ruling class.
Of course, it is the ideas of the ruling class that receive attention
and implementation, but this does not mean that other ideas do not
exist. Husami goes as far as to argue that members of the proletariat
under capitalism have an account of justice that matches communism.
From this privileged standpoint of the proletariat, which is also
Marx’s standpoint, capitalism is unjust, and so it follows that
Marx thought capitalism unjust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Plausible though it may sound, Husami’s argument fails to
account for two related points. First, it cannot explain why Marx
never explicitly described capitalism as unjust, and second, it
overlooks the distance Marx wanted to place between his own scientific
socialism, and that of other socialists who argued for the injustice
of capitalism. Hence one cannot avoid the conclusion that the
“official” view of Marx is that capitalism is not
unjust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nevertheless, this leaves us with a puzzle. Much of Marx’s
description of capitalism—his use of the words
“embezzlement”, “robbery” and
“exploitation”—belie the official account. Arguably,
the only satisfactory way of understanding this issue is, once more,
from G.A. Cohen, who proposes that Marx believed that capitalism was
unjust, but did not believe that he believed it was unjust (Cohen
1983). In other words, Marx, like so many of us, did not have perfect
knowledge of his own mind. In his explicit reflections on the justice
of capitalism he was able to maintain his official view. But in less
guarded moments his real view slips out, even if never in explicit
language. Such an interpretation is bound to be controversial, but it
makes good sense of the texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Whatever one concludes on the question of whether Marx thought
capitalism unjust, it is, nevertheless, obvious that Marx thought that
capitalism was not the best way for human beings to live. Points made
in his early writings remain present throughout his writings, if no
longer connected to an explicit theory of alienation. The worker finds
work a torment, suffers poverty, overwork and lack of fulfilment and
freedom. People do not relate to each other as humans should. Does
this amount to a moral criticism of capitalism or not? In the absence
of any special reason to argue otherwise, it simply seems obvious that
Marx’s critique is a moral one. Capitalism impedes human
flourishing. It is hard to disagree with the judgement that Marx&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
thinks that the capitalist exploitation of labor power is a wrong that
has horrendous consequences for the laborers. (Roberts 2017: 129)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx, though, once more refrained from making this explicit; he seemed
to show no interest in locating his criticism of capitalism in any of
the traditions of moral philosophy, or explaining how he was
generating a new tradition. There may have been two reasons for his
caution. The first was that while there were bad things about
capitalism, there is, from a world historical point of view, much good
about it too. For without capitalism, communism would not be possible.
Capitalism is to be transcended, not abolished, and this may be
difficult to convey in the terms of moral philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Second, and perhaps more importantly, we need to return to the
contrast between Marxian and other forms of socialism. Many
non-Marxian socialists appealed to universal ideas of truth and
justice to defend their proposed schemes, and their theory of
transition was based on the idea that appealing to moral sensibilities
would be the best, perhaps only, way of bringing about the new chosen
society. Marx wanted to distance himself from these other socialist
traditions, and a key point of distinction was to argue that the route
to understanding the possibilities of human emancipation lay in the
analysis of historical and social forces, not in morality. Hence, for
Marx, any appeal to morality was theoretically a backward step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CommJust"&gt;5.3 Communism and “Justice”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This leads us now to Marx’s assessment of communism. Would
communism be a just society? In considering Marx’s attitude to
communism and justice there are really only two viable possibilities:
either he thought that communism would be a just society or he thought
that the concept of justice would not apply: that communism would
transcend justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Communism is described by Marx, in the &lt;em&gt;Critique of the Gotha
Programme&lt;/em&gt;, as a society in which each person should contribute
according to their ability and receive according to their need. This
certainly sounds like a theory of justice, and could be adopted as
such (Gilabert 2015). However, many will hold that it is truer to
Marx’s thought to say that this is part of an account in which
communism transcends justice, as Lukes has argued (Lukes 1987).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If we start with the idea that the point of ideas of justice is to
resolve disputes, then a society without disputes would have no need
or place for justice. We can see this by reflecting upon the idea of
the circumstances of justice in the work of David Hume
(1711–1776). Hume argued that if there was enormous material
abundance—if everyone could have whatever they wanted without
invading another’s share—we would never have devised rules
of justice. And, of course, there are suggestions in Marx’s
writings that communism would be a society of such abundance. But Hume
also suggested that justice would not be needed in other
circumstances; if there were complete fellow-feeling between all human
beings, there would be no conflict and no need for justice. Of course,
one can argue whether either material abundance or human
fellow-feeling to this degree would be possible, but the point is that
both arguments give a clear sense in which communism transcends
justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nevertheless, we remain with the question of whether Marx thought that
communism could be commended on other moral grounds. On a broad
understanding, in which morality, or perhaps better to say ethics, is
concerned with the idea of living well, it seems that communism can be
assessed favourably in this light. One compelling argument is that
Marx’s career simply makes no sense unless we can attribute such
a belief to him. But beyond this we can be brief in that the
considerations adduced in
 &lt;a href=""&gt;Section 2&lt;/a&gt;
 above apply again. Communism clearly advances human flourishing, in
Marx’s view. The only reason for denying that, in Marx’s
vision, it would amount to a good society is a theoretical antipathy
to the word “good”. And here the main point is that, in
Marx’s view, communism would not be brought about by high-minded
benefactors of humanity. Quite possibly his determination to retain
this point of difference between himself and other socialists led him
to disparage the importance of morality to a degree that goes beyond
the call of theoretical necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ideo"&gt;6. Ideology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CritAcco"&gt;6.1 A Critical Account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The account of ideology contained in Marx’s writings is
regularly portrayed as a crucial element of his intellectual legacy.
It has been identified as among his “most influential”
ideas (Elster 1986: 168), and acclaimed as “the most
fertile” part of his social and political theory (Leiter 2004:
84). Not least, these views on ideology are said to constitute
Marx’s claim to a place—alongside Friedrich Nietzsche
(1844–1900) and Sigmund Freud (1856–1939)—as one of
the “masters of suspicion”; that is, as an author whose
work casts doubt on the transparency of our everyday understandings of
both our own identity and the social world we inhabit (Ricouer 1970:
32–33).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Given this enthusiastic reception, it can come as something of a
surprise to turn to Marx’s writings and discover how little they
contain about ideology, and how inchoate and opaque those infrequent
and passing observations on that topic are. There are, of course, some
famous quotations, not least from &lt;em&gt;The German Ideology&lt;/em&gt;
manuscripts. The references there to ideology as involving an
“inversion” of the relation between individuals and their
circumstances, perhaps analogous to the workings of a “camera
obscura”—an optical device which projected an image of its
surroundings, upside down but preserving perspective, onto a screen
inside—have often mesmerised commentators but not always
generated much genuine illumination (&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 5: 36). The point
should not be exaggerated, but these striking images notwithstanding,
there is no clear and sustained discussion of ideology in the Marxian
corpus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many commentators maintain that the search for a single model of
ideology in his work has to be given up. Indeed, there is something of
an “arms race” in the literature, as commentators discover
two, three, even five, competing models of ideology in Marx’s
writings (Mepham 1979; Wood 1981 [2004]; Rosen 1996). Most
surprisingly, it seems that some licence can be found in Marx’s
corpus for three very different ways of thinking about what ideology
is. There is textual evidence of his variously utilising: a
“descriptive” account of ideology involving a broadly
anthropological study of the beliefs and rituals characteristic of
certain groups; a “positive” account of ideology as a
“worldview” providing the members of a group with a sense
of meaning and identity; and a “critical” account seeking
to liberate individuals from certain false and misleading forms of
understanding (Geuss 1981: 4–26).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is the last of these—the critical account rather than either
of the two “non-critical” accounts—which is central
to his wider social and political theory, but this account is itself
subject to some considerable interpretative disagreement. Marx’s
theory of ideology is usually portrayed as an element in what might be
called Marx’s sociology, as distinct from his philosophical
anthropology say, or his theory of history (although complexly related
to the latter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IdeoStab"&gt;6.2 Ideology and Stability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx does not view ideology as a feature of all societies, and, in
particular, suggests that it will not be a feature of a future
communist society. However, ideology is portrayed as a feature of all
class-divided societies, and not only of capitalist
society—although many of Marx’s comments on ideology are
concerned with the latter. The theory of ideology appears to play a
role in explaining a feature of class-divided societies which might
otherwise appear puzzling, namely what might be called their
“stability”; that is, the absence of overt and serious
conflict between social classes. This stability is not permanent, but
it can last for extended historical periods. This stability appears
puzzling to Marx because class-divided societies are flawed in ways
which not only frustrate human flourishing, but also work to the
material advantage of the ruling minority. Why do the subordinate
classes, who form a majority, tolerate these flaws, when resistance
and rebellion of various kinds might be in their objective
interests?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx’s account of the sources of social stability in
class-divided societies appeals to both repressive and non-repressive
mechanisms. Such societies might often involve the direct repression
(or the threat of it) of one group by another, but Marx does not think
that this is the whole story. There are also non-repressive sources of
social stability, and ideology is usually, and plausibly, considered
one of these. Very roughly, Marx’s account of ideology claims
that the dominant social ideas in such societies are typically false
or misleading in a fashion that works to the advantage of the
economically dominant class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We should note that ideology would seem to be a part and not the whole
of Marx’s account of the non-repressive sources of stability in
class divided societies. Other factors might include: dull economic
pressure, including the daily grind of having to earn a living;
doubts—justified or otherwise—about the feasibility of
alternatives; sensitivity to the possible costs of radical social
change; and collective action problems of various kinds which face
those who do want to rebel and resist. Marx does not think individuals
are permanently trapped within ideological modes of thinking. Ideology
may have an initial hold, but it is not portrayed as impervious to
reason and evidence, especially in circumstances in which the
objective conditions for social change obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Char"&gt;6.3 Characteristics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For Marx ideological beliefs are social in that they are widely
shared, indeed so widely-shared that for long periods they constitute
the “ruling” or “dominant” ideas in a given
class-divided society (&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 5: 59). And they are social in
that they directly concern, or indirectly impact upon, the
action-guiding understandings of self and society that individuals
have. These action-guiding understandings include the dominant legal,
political, religious, and philosophical views within particular
class-divided societies in periods of stability (MECW 29: 263).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not all false or misleading beliefs count for Marx as ideological.
Honest scientific error, for example can be non-ideological. And
ideological belief can be misleading without being strictly false. For
example, defenders of the capitalist economy portray what Marx calls
the “wage form”, with its exchange of equivalents, as the
whole (rather than a part) of the story about the relation between
capital and labour, thereby ignoring the exploitation which occurs in
the sphere of production. Indeed, the notion of the
“falsity” of ideology needs to be expanded beyond the
content of the “ideas” in question, to include cases where
their origins are in some way contaminated (Geuss 1981: 19–22).
Perhaps the only reason I believe something to be the case is that the
belief in question has a consoling effect on me. Arguably such a
belief is held ideologically, even if it happens to be true.
Nevertheless paradigmatic examples of ideology have a false content.
For example, ideology often portrays institutions, policies, and
decisions which are in the interests of the economically dominant
class, as being in the interests of the society as a whole
(&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 5: 60); and ideology often portrays social and
political arrangements which are contingent, or historical, or
artificial, as being necessary, or universal, or natural
(&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 35: 605).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In addition to false or misleading content, ideological beliefs
typically have at least two additional characteristics, relating to
their social origin and their class function. By the “social
origin” of ideology is meant that Marx thinks of these ideas as
often originating with, and being reinforced by, the complex structure
of class-divided societies—a complex structure in which a
deceptive surface appearance is governed by underlying essential
relations (Geras 1986: 63–84). Capitalism is seen as especially
deceptive in appearance; for example, Marx often contrasts the
relative transparency of “exploitation” under feudalism,
with the way in which the “wage form” obscures the ratio
of necessary and surplus labour in capitalist societies. Ideology
stems, in part, from this deceptive surface appearance which makes it
difficult to grasp the underlying social flaws that benefit the
economically dominant class. Marx portrays the striving to uncover
essences concealed by misleading appearances as characteristic of
scientific endeavour (&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 37, 804). And, in this context, he
distinguishes between classical political economy, which
strove—albeit not always successfully—to uncover the
essential relations often concealed behind misleading appearances, and
what he calls vulgar economy, which happily restricts itself to the
misleading appearances themselves (&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 37, 804).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By the “class function” of ideology is meant that Marx
holds that the pervasiveness of ideology is explained by the fact it
helps stabilise the economic structure of societies. All sorts of
ideas might get generated for all sorts of reasons, but the ones that
tend to “stick” (become widely accepted) in class-divided
societies do so, not because of their truth, but because they conceal
or misrepresent or justify flaws in that society in ways which redound
to the benefit of the economically dominant class (Rosen &amp;amp; Wolff
1996: 235–236).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In response critics often see this as just another example of sloppy
functional reasoning—purportedly widespread in the Marxist
tradition—whereby a general pattern is asserted without the
identification of any of the mechanisms which might generate that
pattern. In the present case, it is said that Marx never properly
explains why the ruling ideas should be those of the ruling class
(Elster 1985: 473). Yet there are obvious possible mechanisms here. To
give two examples. First, there is the control of the ruling class
over the means of mental production, and in particular the print and
broadcast media which in capitalist societies are typically owned and
controlled by the very wealthy (&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 5, 59). A second
possible mechanism appeals to the psychological need of individuals
for invented narratives that legitimise or justify their social
position; for instance, Marx identifies a widespread need, in flawed
societies, for the consolatory effects of religion (&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 3,
175).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="StatPoli"&gt;7. State and Politics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This broad heading—the state and politics—could cover very
many different issues. To make the present account manageable, only
two are addressed here: Marx’s account of the state in
capitalist society; and Marx’s account of the fate of the state
in communist society. (Consequently, many other important political
issues—the nature of pre-capitalist states, relations between
states, the political transition to communism, and so on—are not
dealt with.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="StatCapiSoci"&gt;7.1 The State in Capitalist Society&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx offers no unified theoretical account of the state in capitalist
society. Instead his remarks on this topic are scattered across the
course of his activist life, and deeply embedded in discussions of
contemporary events, events which most modern readers will know very
little about. Providing some initial order to that complexity, Jon
Elster helpfully identifies three different models in Marx’s
writings of the relationship, in capitalist society, between the
political state, on the one hand, and the economically dominant class,
on the other. (The next three paragraphs draw heavily on Elster 1985:
409–437.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, the “instrumental” model portrays the state as
simply a tool, directly controlled by the economically dominant class,
in its own interests, at the expense of the interests both of other
classes and of the community as a whole. Marx is usually said to
endorse the instrumental account in the &lt;em&gt;Communist Manifesto&lt;/em&gt;,
where he and Engels insist that “the executive of the modern
state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole
bourgeoisie” (&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 6: 486). On this account, the state
might also act against the short term, or the factional, interests of
particular capitalists. The picture here is of the state as an
instrument directed—presumably by a subset of capitalists or
their representatives—in ways which promote the long term
interests of the bourgeoisie as a whole. The precise mechanisms which
might facilitate that result are not clear in Marx’s
writings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Second, the “class balance” model portrays the state as
having interests of its own, with capitalist interests as merely one
of the strategic limits on its pursuit of these. This model gets its
name from the exceptional social circumstances said to explain the
independence of the state in this case. In situations where the social
power of the two warring classes of contemporary
society—capitalists and workers—are very nearly balanced,
the political state (and especially the executive) can gain
independence from both, exploiting that conflict in order to promote
its own interests (the interests of the political caste). Something
like this picture appears in Marx’s discussions of the continued
existence of certain absolutist states after the revolutions of 1848,
and of the Bonapartist state established in France by the coup of
Napoleon III in December 1851. The state now competes with capitalists
and proletarians (and is not merely the tool of the former), and by
“promising each of the major classes to protect it against the
other, the government can rule autonomously” (Elster 1985: 425).
On this account, the state has interests of its own, but presumably
only gets to pursue them if those promises to others are plausible,
finding some reflection in its policies and behaviour. Capitalist
interests accordingly remain a political constraint, but they are now
only one of the factors constraining the state’s actions rather
than constituting its primary goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Third, the “abdication” model presents the bourgeoisie as
staying away from the direct exercise of political power, but doing
this because it is in their economic interests to do so. As Elster
notes, strictly speaking, “abdication” here covers two
slightly different cases—first, where the bourgeoisie
&lt;em&gt;abdicate&lt;/em&gt; from the political power that they initially
controlled (relevant to France); and, second, where the bourgeoisie
&lt;em&gt;abstain&lt;/em&gt; from taking political power in the first place
(relevant to Britain and Germany)—but they can be treated
together. In both cases, Marx identifies a situation where “in
order to save its purse, [the bourgeoisie] must forfeit the
crown” (&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 11: 143). Where the instrumental picture
claims that the state acts in the interests of the capitalist class
&lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it is directly controlled by the latter, the
abdication picture advances an &lt;em&gt;explanatory connection&lt;/em&gt; between
the promotion of bourgeois interests and the retreat from the direct
exercise of power. Circumstances obtain where “the political
rule of the bourgeoisie” turns out to be
“incompatible” with its continued economic flourishing,
and the bourgeoisie seeks “to get rid of its own political rule
in order to get rid of the troubles and dangers of ruling”
(&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 11: 173). There are several possible explanations of
why the bourgeoisie might remain outside of politics in order to
promote their own interests. To give three examples: the bourgeoisie
might recognise that their own characteristic short-termism could be
fatal to their own interests if they exercised direct political as
well as economic power; the bourgeoisie might find political rule
sufficiently time and effort consuming to withdraw from it,
discovering that the economic benefits kept on coming regardless; or
the bourgeoisie might appreciate that abdication weakened their class
opponents, forcing the proletariat to fight on two fronts (against
capital and government) and thereby making it less able to win those
struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are many questions one might have about these three models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, one might wonder which of these three models best embodies
Marx’s considered view? The instrumental account is the earliest
account, which he largely abandons from the early 1850s, presumably
noticing how poorly it captured contemporary political
realities—in particular, the stable existence of states which
were not directly run by the capitalist class, but which still in some
way served their interests. That outcome is possible under either of
the two other accounts. However, Marx seems to have thought of the
class balance model as a temporary solution in exceptional
circumstances, and perhaps held that it failed to allow the stable
explanatory connection that he sought between the extant political
arrangements and the promotion of dominant economic interests. In
short, for better or worse, Marx’s considered view looks closer
to the abdication account, reflecting his conviction that the central
features of political life are explained by the existing economic
structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Second, one might wonder which model allows greatest
“autonomy” to the political state? A weak definition of
state autonomy might portray the state as autonomous when it is
independent of direct control by the economically dominant class. On
this definition, both the class balance and abdication
models—but not the instrumental account—seem to provide
for autonomy. A stronger definition of state autonomy might require
what Elster calls “explanatory autonomy”, which exists&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
when (and to the extent that) its structure and policies cannot be
explained by the interest of an economically dominant class. (Elster
1985: 405)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Only the class balance view seems to allow significant explanatory
autonomy. In his preferred abdication account, Marx allows that the
state in capitalist society is independent of direct capitalist
control, but goes on to claim that its main structures (including that
very independence) and policies are ultimately explained by the
interests of the capitalist class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FateStatCommSoci"&gt;7.2. The Fate of the State in Communist Society&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For reasons discussed below (see
 &lt;a href=""&gt;Section 8&lt;/a&gt;),
 Marx declines to say much about the basic structure of a future
communist society. However, in the case of the fate of the state, that
reluctance is partially mitigated by his view that the institutional
arrangements of the Paris Commune prefigured the political dimensions
of communist society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx’s views on the nature and fate of the state in communist
society are to be distinguished from his infrequent, and subsequently
notorious, use of the term “the dictatorship of the
proletariat”. (On the infrequency, context, and content, of
these uses see Draper 1986 and Hunt 1974.) The idea of
“dictatorship” in this historical context has the
(ancient) connotation of emergency rule rather than the (modern)
connotation of totalitarianism. Marx’s use makes it clear that
any such temporary government should be democratic; for instance, in
having majority support, and in preserving democratic rights (of
speech, association, and so on). However, it is by definition
“extra-legal” in that it seeks to establish a new regime
and not to preserve an old one. So understood, the dictatorship of the
proletariat forms part of the political transition to communist
society (a topic not covered here), rather than part of the
institutional structure of communist society itself. The
“dictatorial”—that is, the temporary and
extra-legal—character of this regime ends with establishment of
a new and stable polity, and it is the latter which is discussed here
(Hunt 1974: 297).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The character of the state in communist society consists, in part, of
its form (its institutional arrangements) and its function (the tasks
that it undertakes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some sense of the &lt;em&gt;form&lt;/em&gt; of the state in communist society can
be gained from Marx’s engagement with the Paris Commune. His
preferred future political arrangements involve a high degree of
participation, and the radical “de-professionalisation” of
certain public offices. First, Marx is enthusiastic about regular
elections, universal suffrage, &lt;em&gt;mandat impératif&lt;/em&gt;,
recall, open executive proceedings, decentralisation, and so on.
Second, he objects to public offices (in the legislature, executive,
and judiciary) being the spoils of a political caste, and sought to
make them working positions, remunerated at the average worker’s
wage, and regularly circulating (through election). This combination
of arrangements has been characterised as “democracy without
professionals” (Hunt 1974: 365). Marx saw it as reflecting his
view that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Freedom consists in converting the state from an organ superimposed
upon society into one completely subordinate to it. (&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 24:
94)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some sense of the &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt; of the state in communist society
can be gained from Marx’s distinction between
“necessary” tasks that a state would need to undertake in
all societies (at least, economically developed societies), and
“unnecessary” tasks that a state would only need to
undertake in class-divided societies. The difficulty here is less in
allowing this distinction, than in deciding what might fall into each
category. On the necessary side, Marx appears to require that the
state in communist society provide both: democratic solutions to
coordination problems (deciding which side of the road traffic should
drive on, for instance); and the supply of public goods (health,
welfare, education, and so on). On the unnecessary side, Marx seems to
think that a communist society might hugely reduce, or even eliminate,
the element of organised coercion found in most states (in the form of
standing armies, police forces, and so on). At least, this reduction
might be feasible once communist society had reached its higher stage
(where distribution is based on “the needs principle”),
and there is no longer a threat from non-communist societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Again, there are many reservations that one might have about this
account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, many will be sceptical about its feasibility, and perhaps
especially of the purported reduction, still less elimination, of
state coercion. That scepticism might be motivated by the thought that
this would only be possible if communist society were characterised by
widespread social and political consensus, and that such consensus is,
both unlikely (at least, in modern societies), and undesirable
(diversity and disagreement having a value). However, the reduction,
or even elimination, of state coercion might be compatible with
certain forms of continuing disagreement about the ends and means of
communist society. Imagine that a democratic communist polity
introduces a new law prohibiting smoking in public places, and that a
representative smoker (call her Anne) obeys that law despite being
among the minority who wanted this practice permitted. Anne’s
motivation for obedience, we can stipulate, is grounded, not in fear
of the likely response of bodies of armed persons enforcing the law,
but rather in respect for the democratic majority of the community of
which she is a part. In short, reasonably strong assumptions about the
democratic commitments of individuals might allow the scaling down of
organised coercion without having to presume universal agreement
amongst citizens on all issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Second, some might object to the reference, throughout this section,
to the “state” in communist society. It might be said that
a polity whose form and functions are so radically
transformed—the form by democratic participation and
de-professionalisation, the function by eliminating historically
unnecessary tasks—is insufficiently “state-like” to
be called a state. That is certainly possible, but the terminological
claim would appear to assume that there is greater clarity and
agreement about just what a state is, either than is presupposed here
or than exists in the world. Given that lack of consensus,
“state” seems a suitably prudent choice. As well as being
consistent with some of Marx’s usage, it avoids prejudging this
very issue. However, anyone unmoved by those considerations can simply
replace “state”, in this context, with their own preferred
alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Utop"&gt;8. Utopianism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UtopSoci"&gt;8.1 Utopian Socialism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is well-known that Marx never provided a detailed account of the
basic structure of the future communist society that he predicted.
This was not simply an omission on his part, but rather reflects his
deliberate commitment, as he colloquially has it, to refrain from
writing “recipes” for the “restaurants” of the
future (&lt;em&gt;MECW&lt;/em&gt; 35: 17, translation amended).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The reasoning that underpins this commitment can be reconstructed from
Marx’s engagement with the radical political tradition that he
called “utopian socialism”, and whose founding triumvirate
were Charles Fourier (1772–1837), Henri Saint-Simon
(1760–1825), and Robert Owen (1771–1858). Note that the
distinction between Marxian socialism and utopian socialism is not an
exhaustive one. Marx happily allows that there are socialists who are
neither Marxian nor Utopian; for example, the “feudal
socialists” discussed in the &lt;em&gt;Communist Manifesto&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What distinguishes utopian from other socialists is, in large part,
their view that providing persuasive &lt;em&gt;constructive&lt;/em&gt; plans and
blueprints of future socialist arrangements is a legitimate and
necessary activity. (The expression “plans and blueprints”
is used here to capture the necessary &lt;em&gt;detail&lt;/em&gt; of these
descriptions, and not to suggest that these designs have to be thought
of as “stipulative”, as having to be followed to the
letter.) On the utopian account, the socialist future needs to be
designed before it can be delivered; the plans and blueprints being
intended to guide and motivate socialists in their transformative
ambitions. Of course, that Marx is not &lt;em&gt;in this sense&lt;/em&gt; utopian
does not rule out the possibility of additional (here unspecified)
senses in which he might accurately be so described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx’s account of utopian socialism might appear contradictory.
It is certainly easy to find not only passages fiercely criticising
utopian authors and texts, but also passages generously praising them.
However, that criticism and that praise turn out to attach to slightly
different targets, revealing an underlying and consistent structure to
his account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That underlying structure rests on two main distinctions. The first
distinction is a &lt;em&gt;chronological&lt;/em&gt; one running between the
founding triumvirate, on the one hand, and second and subsequent
generations of utopian socialists, on the other. (These later
generations including both loyal followers of the founding
triumvirate, and independent later figures such as Étienne
Cabet (1788–1856)). The second distinction is a
&lt;em&gt;substantive&lt;/em&gt; one running between the critical part of utopian
writings (the portrayal of faults within contemporary capitalist
society), on the one hand, and the constructive part of utopian
writings (the detailed description of the ideal socialist future), on
the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Note that these distinctions underpin the asymmetry of Marx’s
assessment of utopian socialism. Simply put: he is more enthusiastic
and positive about the achievements of the first generation of
utopians, by comparison with those of second and subsequent
generations; and he is more enthusiastic and positive about the
utopians’ criticism of contemporary society, by comparison with
the utopians’ constructive endeavours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MarxUtop"&gt;8.2 Marx’s Utopophobia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The remainder of this section will focus on Marx’s disapproval
of the constructive endeavours of the utopians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In trying to organise and understand Marx’s various criticisms
of utopianism, it is helpful to distinguish between foundational and
non-foundational variants. (This distinction is intended to be
exhaustive, in that all of his criticisms of utopianism will fall into
one of these two categories.) &lt;em&gt;Non-foundational&lt;/em&gt; criticisms of
utopian socialism are those which, if sound, would provide us with a
reason to reject views which might be held by, or even be
characteristic of, utopian socialists, but which are not constitutive
of their utopianism. That is, they would give us a reason to abandon
the relevant beliefs, or to criticise those (including utopians) who
held them, but they would not give us cause to reject utopianism as
such. In contrast, &lt;em&gt;foundational&lt;/em&gt; criticisms of utopian
socialism are those which, if sound, would provide us with a reason to
reject utopianism as such; that is, a reason to refrain from engaging
in socialist design, a reason not to describe in relevant detail the
socialist society of the future. (Of course, that reason might not be
decisive, all things considered, but it would still count against
utopianism per se.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many of Marx’s best-known criticisms of utopian socialism are
non-foundational. For instance, in the &lt;em&gt;Communist Manifesto&lt;/em&gt;,
he complains that utopian socialists hold a mistaken
“ahistorical” view of social change. The utopians
purportedly fail to understand that the achievement of socialism
depends on conditions which can only emerge at a certain stage of
historical development. They might, for instance, recognise that there
are strategic preconditions for socialism (for instance, the right
blueprint and sufficient will to put it into practice), but
(mistakenly on Marx’s account) imagine that those preconditions
could have appeared at any point in time. This complaint is
non-foundational in that one can accept that there are historical
conditions for establishing a socialist society, and that the utopian
socialists fail to understand this, without thereby having a reason to
abandon utopianism as such. A commitment to the necessity and
desirability of socialist design does not require one to hold an
“ahistorical” view of social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Assessing the soundness of non-foundational criticisms, and their
relevance to the utopian socialist tradition, is a complicated task
(see Leopold 2018). However, even if sound and relevant, these
criticisms would provide no reason to abandon utopianism &lt;em&gt;as
such&lt;/em&gt;. Consequently, they are pursued no further here. Instead,
the focus is on the three main foundational arguments against
utopianism that can be located in Marx’s writings; namely, that
utopian plans and blueprints are &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; undemocratic,
impossible, and redundant (see Leopold 2016).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx’s first argument involves a &lt;em&gt;normative&lt;/em&gt; claim that
utopian plans and blueprints are &lt;em&gt;undemocratic&lt;/em&gt;.
(“Democracy” here connoting individual and collective
self-determination, rather than political forms of governance.) The
basic argument runs: that it is undemocratic to limit the
self-determination of individuals; that providing a plan or blueprint
for a socialist society limits the self-determination of individuals;
and that therefore the provision of plans and blueprints for a
socialist society is undemocratic. If we add in the assumption that
undemocratic means are undesirable; then we can conclude that it is
undesirable to provide plans or blueprints of a future socialist
society. One central reason for resisting this argument is that it is
hard to identify a plausible account of the conditions for
self-determination, according to which it is necessarily true that
merely providing a socialist plan or blueprint restricts
self-determination. Indeed, one might heretically think that detailed
plans and blueprints often tend to promote self-determination, helping
individuals think about where it is they want to go, and how they want
to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx’s second argument rests on an &lt;em&gt;epistemological&lt;/em&gt;
claim that that utopian plans and blueprints are &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt;,
because they require accurate knowledge of the future of a kind which
cannot be had. The basic argument starts from the assumption that to
be of any use a blueprint must facilitate the construction of a future
socialist society. Moreover, to facilitate the construction of a
future socialist society a blueprint must be completely accurate; and
to be completely accurate a blueprint must predict all the relevant
circumstances of that future society. However, since it is not
possible—given the complexity of the social world and the
limitations of human nature—to predict all the relevant
circumstances of that future society, we can conclude that socialist
blueprints are of no use. One central reason for resisting this
argument is that, whilst it is hard to deny that completely accurate
plans are impossible (given the complexity of the world and the
limitations of human understanding), the claim that only completely
accurate plans are useful seems doubtful. Plans are not simply
predictions, and providing less than wholly accurate plans for
ourselves often forms part of the process whereby we help determine
the future for ourselves (insofar as that is possible).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx’s third argument depends on an &lt;em&gt;empirical&lt;/em&gt; claim
that utopian plans and blueprints are &lt;em&gt;unnecessary&lt;/em&gt;, because
satisfactory solutions to social problems emerge automatically from
the unfolding of the historical process without themselves needing to
be designed. The basic argument runs as follows: that utopian
blueprints describe the basic structure of the socialist society of
the future; and that such blueprints are necessary if and only if the
basic structure of future socialist society needs to be designed.
However, given that the basic structure of the future socialist
society develops automatically (without design assistance) within
capitalist society; and that the role of human agency in this
unfolding historical process is to deliver (not design) that basic
structure, Marx concludes that utopian blueprints are redundant.
Reasons for resisting this argument include scepticism about both
Marx’s reasoning and the empirical record. Marx is certain that
humankind does not need to design the basic structure of the future
socialist society, but it is not really made clear who or what does
that designing in its place. Moreover, the path of historical
development since Marx’s day does not obviously confirm the
complex empirical claim that the basic structure of socialist society
is developing automatically within existing capitalism, needing only
to be delivered (and not designed) by human agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This brief discussion suggests that there are cogent grounds for
doubting Marx’s claim that utopian plans and blueprints are
&lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; undemocratic, impossible, and redundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, recall that Marx is less enthusiastic about the second and
subsequent generations of utopians, than he is about the original
triumvirate. We might reasonably wonder about the rationale for
greater criticism of later utopians. It is important to recognise that
it is not that second and subsequent generations make more or grosser
errors than the original triumvirate. (Indeed, Marx appears to think
that all these different generations largely held the same views, and
made the same mistakes). The relevant difference is rather that, by
comparison with their successors, this first generation were not to
blame for those errors. In short, the rationale behind Marx’s
preference for the first over the second and subsequent generations of
utopian socialists is based on an understanding of historical
development and an associated notion of &lt;em&gt;culpability&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marx held that the intellectual formation of this first generation
took place in a historical context (the cusp of the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries) which was sufficiently developed to provoke
socialist criticism, but not sufficiently developed for that socialist
criticism to escape serious misunderstandings (Cohen 2000: 51). Since
neither the material conditions of modern society, nor the historical
agent capable of bringing socialism about, were sufficiently
developed, this first generation were bound to develop faulty accounts
of the nature of, and transition to, socialism. However, that
defence—the historical unavoidability of error—is not
available to subsequent generations who, despite significantly changed
circumstances, hold fast to the original views of their intellectual
forerunners. Marx maintains that more recent utopians, unlike the
original triumvirate, really ought to know better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MarxLega"&gt;9. Marx’s Legacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At this point, we might be expected briefly to survey Marx’s
legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That legacy is often elaborated in terms of movements and thinkers.
However, so understood, the controversy and scale of that legacy make
brevity impossible, and this entry is already long enough. All we can
do here is gesture at the history and mention some further
reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The chronology here might provisionally be divided into three
historical periods: from Marx’s death until the Russia
Revolution (1917); from the Russian Revolution to the fall of the
Berlin Wall (1989); and since 1989. It seems hard to say much that is
certain about the last of these periods, but some generalisations
about the first two might be hazarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That first period of “Classical Marxism” can be thought of
in two generational waves. The first smaller group of theorists was
associated with the Second International, and includes Karl Kautsky
(1854–1938) and Plekhanov. The succeeding more activist
generation includes Rosa Luxemburg (1871–1919), V.I. Lenin
(1870–1924) and Leon Trotsky (1879–1940).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second period is perhaps dominated by “Soviet Marxism”
and the critical reaction from other Marxists that it provoked. The
repressive bureaucratic regimes which solidified in the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe repressed independent theoretical work, including
scholarly editorial work on the writings of Marx and Engels. However,
they also provoked a critical reaction in the form of a body of
thought often called “Western Marxism”, usually said to
include the work of Antonio Gramsci (1891–1937), Theodor Adorno
(1903–1969), and Althusser. The later parts of this period saw
the continuing development of “Critical Theory”, as well
as the birth of currents such as “Analytical Marxism”
whose longer term impact is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These first two periods are both partly covered by the Polish
philosopher and historian of ideas, Leszek Kołakowski, in the
final two volumes of his encyclopaedic three volume &lt;em&gt;Main Currents
of Marxism&lt;/em&gt; (1976 [1978]). A succinct critical account of the
emergence and distinctive character of Western Marxism is provided by
Perry Anderson in his &lt;em&gt;Considerations on Western Marxism&lt;/em&gt;
(1976). And some of the more philosophically interesting authors in
this latter tradition are also covered elsewhere in this Encyclopaedia
(see the
 &lt;a href="#Rel"&gt;Related Entries&lt;/a&gt;
 section below). Finally, and edging a little into the third of these
historical periods, Christoph Henning offers an account of the (mis)
readings of Marx—especially those replacing social theory with
moral philosophy—in German philosophy from Heidegger to Habermas
and beyond, in his &lt;em&gt;Philosophy After Marx&lt;/em&gt; (2014).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, we might also think of Marx’s legacy, less in terms of
thinkers and movements, and more in terms of reasons for wanting to
study Marx’s ideas. In that context, we would stress that this
is not simply a question of the truth of his various substantive
claims. The work of philosophers is, of course, also valued for the
originality, insight, potential, and so on, that it may also contain.
And, so judged, Marx’s writings have much to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The various strands of Marx’s thought surveyed here include his
philosophical anthropology, his theory of history, his critical
engagement with the economic and political dimensions of capitalism,
and a frustratingly vague outline of what might replace it. Whatever
the connections between these threads, it seems implausible to suggest
that Marx’s ideas form a system which has to be swallowed or
rejected in its entirety. It might, for instance, be that Marx’s
diagnosis looks more persuasive than his remedies. Readers may have
little confidence in his solutions, but that does not mean that the
problems he identifies are not acute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="Lif"&gt;1. Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Louis Althusser was born on October 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1918 in
Birmandreis, a suburb of Algiers. Hailing from Alsace on his
father’s side of the family, his grandparents were &lt;em&gt;pieds
noirs&lt;/em&gt;, or French citizens who had chosen to settle in Algeria. At
the time of his birth, Althusser’s father was a lieutenant in the
French Military. After this service was up, his father returned to
Algiers and to his work as a banker. By all accounts save for the
retrospective ones contained in his autobiographies, Althusser’s
early childhood in North Africa was a contented one. There he enjoyed
the comforts of the Mediterranean environment as well as those provided
by an extended and stable petit-bourgeois family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

In 1930, his father’s work moved the family to Marseille.
Always a good pupil, Althusser excelled in his studies and became
active in the Scouts. In 1936, the family moved again, this time to
Lyon. There, Althusser was enrolled in the prestigious Lycée du
Parc. At the Lycée, he began taking classes in order to prepare
for the competitive entrance exams to France’s &lt;em&gt;grandes
écoles&lt;/em&gt;. Raised in an observant family, Althusser was
particularly influenced by professors of a distinctly Catholic
tendency. These included the philosophers Jean Guitton and Jean Lacroix
as well as the historian Joseph Hours. In 1937, while still at the
Lycée, Althusser joined the Catholic youth group &lt;em&gt;Jeunesse
étudiantes chrétiennes&lt;/em&gt;. This interest in Catholicism
and his participation in Catholic organizations would continue even
after Althusser joined the Communist Party in 1948. The simultaneous
enthusiasm that Althusser showed in Lyon for Royalist politics did not
last the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

In 1939, Althusser performed well enough on the national entrance
examinations to be admitted to the École Normale
Supérieure (ENS) in Paris. However, before the school year
began, he was mobilized into the army. Soon thereafter, he was captured
in Vannes along with the rest of his artillery regiment. He spent the
remainder of the war as a prisoner of war at a camp in Northern
Germany. In his autobiographical writings, Althusser credits the
experiences of solidarity, political action, and community that he
found in the camp as opening him up to the idea of communism. Indeed,
his prison writings collected as &lt;em&gt;Journal de captivité,
Stalag XA 1940–1945&lt;/em&gt; evidence these experiences. They also provide
evidence of the cycles of deep depression that began for Althusser in
1938 and that would mark him for the rest of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

At the end of the war and following his release from the P.O.W.
camp in 1945, Althusser took his place at the ENS. Now 27 years old, he
began the program of study that was to prepare him for the
&lt;em&gt;agrégation&lt;/em&gt;, the competitive examination which qualifies
one to teach philosophy in French secondary schools and that is often
the gateway to doctoral study and university employment. Perhaps not
surprisingly for a young man who had just spent half a decade in a
prison camp, much happened during the three years he spent preparing
for the exam and working on his Master’s thesis. Though still
involved in Catholic groups and still seeing himself as a Christian,
the movements that Althusser associated with after the war were leftist
in their politics and, intellectually, he made a move to embrace and
synthesize Christian and Marxist thought. This synthesis and his first
published works were informed by a reading of 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century
German idealist philosophy, especially Hegel and Marx, as well as by
progressive Christian thinkers associated with the group &lt;em&gt;Jeunesse
de l’Église&lt;/em&gt;. Indeed, it was 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century
German Idealism with which he was most engaged during his period of
study at the ENS. In line with this interest (one shared with many
other French intellectuals at the time), Althusser obtained his
&lt;em&gt;diplôme d’études supérieures&lt;/em&gt; in 1947
for a work directed by Gaston Bachelard and titled “On Content in
the Thought of G.W.F. Hegel.” In 1948, he passed his
&lt;em&gt;agrégation&lt;/em&gt;, coming in first on the written portion of
the exam and second on the oral. After this showing, Althusser was
offered and accepted the post of &lt;em&gt;agrégé
répétiteur&lt;/em&gt; (director of studies) at the ENS whose
responsibility it was to help students prepare for their own
&lt;em&gt;agrégations&lt;/em&gt;. In this capacity, he began offering
courses and tutorials on particular topics in philosophy and on
particular figures from the history of philosophy. As he retained this
responsibility for more than thirty years and worked with some of the
brightest thinkers that France produced during this time (including
Alain Badiou, Pierre Bourdieu, and Michel Foucault), through his
teaching Althusser left a deep and lasting impression on a generation
of French philosophers and on French philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

In addition to inaugurating his extended association with the ENS,
the first few years spent in Paris after the war saw Althusser begin
three other long-lasting relationships. The first of these was
with the French Communist Party, the second with his companion and
eventual wife, Hélène Rytman, and the third with French
psychiatry. Begun to treat recurrent bouts of depression, this last
affiliation continued for the rest of his life and included frequent
hospitalization as well as the most aggressive treatments post-war
French psychiatry had to offer such as electroconvulsive therapy,
narco-analysis, and psychoanalysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The second relationship begun by Althusser was little happier and no
less dependent than the first. At its outset, Althusser’s bond
with Hélène Rytman was complicated by his almost total
inexperience with women and by her being eight years older than him. It was
also made difficult by the vast differences in their experience of the
world and by her relationship with the Communist Party. Whereas
Althusser had known only home, school, and P.O.W. camp, Rytman had
traveled widely and had long been active in literary and radical
circles. At the time the two met, she was also embroiled in a dispute
with the Party over her role in the resistance during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Though Althusser was not yet a Party member, like many of his
generation, he emerged from the War deeply sympathetic to its moral
aims. His interest in Party politics and involvement with Party members
grew during his time as a student at the ENS. However, the ENS’
suspicion of communists as well as Hélène Rytman’s
troubles with the Party complicated Althusser’s relationship with
each of these institutions. Nonetheless, shortly after
being offered the post of &lt;em&gt;agrégé
répétiteur&lt;/em&gt; (and thus safe from being bypassed for
the position due to his membership), Althusser joined the Communist
Party. For the next few years, Althusser tried to advance the aims of
the Communist Party as well as the goal of getting Rytman accepted back
into it. He did so by being a good militant (going to cell
meetings, distributing tracts, etc), by re-starting a Marxist study
group at the ENS (the &lt;em&gt;Cercle Politzer&lt;/em&gt;), and by making
inquiries into Rytman’s wartime activities in the hopes of
clearing her name. By his own account, he made a terrible activist and
he also failed to rehabilitate Rytman’s reputation. Nonetheless,
his relationship with the Party and with Rytman deepened during this
period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

During the 1950s, Althusser lived two lives that were only somewhat
inter-related: one was that of a successful, if somewhat obscure
academic philosopher and pedagogue and the other that of a loyal
Communist Party Member. This is not to say that Althusser was
politically inactive at the school or that his communism did not
influence his philosophical work. On the contrary, Althusser
recruited colleagues and students to the Party and worked closely with
the communist cell based at the ENS. In addition, at mid-decade, he
published a few introductions to Marxist philosophy. However, in his
teaching and advising, he mostly avoided bringing in Marxist philosophy
and Communist politics. Instead, he catered to student interest and to
the demands of each new &lt;em&gt;agrégation&lt;/em&gt; by engaging closely
with classic philosophical texts and with contemporary philosophy and
social science. Further, the bulk of his scholarship was on
18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century political philosophy. Indeed, the only
book-length study Althusser published during his lifetime was a work on
Montesquieu, which appeared at the end of the decade. At the ENS,
Althusser’s professionalism as well as his ability to think
institutionally was rewarded in 1954 with a promotion to
&lt;em&gt;secrétaire de l’école littéraire&lt;/em&gt;,
a post where he had some responsibility for the
management and direction of the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

It would have surprised no one if Althusser had continued to
influence French political and philosophical life subtly, through the
students that he mentored, through his scholarship on the history of
political philosophy, through the colloquia among philosophers,
scientists, and historians that he organized, and through his routine
work as a Party member. However, in 1961, with an essay titled
“On the Young Marx,” Althusser aggressively entered into a
heated debate about the continuity of Marx’s oeuvre and about
what constitutes the core of Marxist philosophy. Appearing at a time of
crisis in the French Communist Party’s direction and seeming to
offer a “scientific” alternative to Stalinism and to the
humanist revisions of Marxism then being proffered, the theoretical
viewpoint offered by Althusser gained adherents. Invigorated by this
recognition and by the possibility that theoretical work might actually
change Communist Party practice, Althusser began to publish regularly
on Marxist philosophy. These essays occasioned much public discussion
and philosophical activity both in France and abroad. At the same time
as these essays began creating a stir, Althusser changed his teaching
style at the ENS and began to offer collaborative seminars where he and
his students attempted a “return to Marx” and to
Marx’s original texts. In 1965, the fruit of one of these
seminars was published as &lt;em&gt;Reading Capital&lt;/em&gt;. That same year, the
essays on Marxist theory that had made such a sensation were collected
and published in the volume &lt;em&gt;For Marx&lt;/em&gt;. Amplifying these
books’ collective impact well beyond the realm of intra-party
discussion was the general trend in literary and social scientific
theory labeled “structuralism” and with which
Althusser’s re-reading of Marx was identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

At mid-decade, Althusser seized on these works’ popularity and the
fact that his arguments had created a faction within the French
Communist Party composed mostly of young intelligentsia to try and
force change within the Party.  This gambit to have the Party
directed by theorists rather than by a Central Committee whose
Stalinism remained entrenched and who believed in the organic wisdom
of the worker met with little success.  At the most, he succeeded in
carving out some autonomy for theoretical reflection within the
Party. Even though it is his most well known intervention, this was
not the first attempt by Althusser to try and influence the Party (he
had tried once before during the mid 1950s from his position as cell
leader at the ENS) and it would not be his last.  While he lost much
of the student support that his work had created when he remained
silent during the “revolutionary” events of May 1968 (he
was in a psychiatric hospital at the time), he campaigned once more to
influence the Party during the mid 1970s. This intervention occurred
in response to the French Communist Party’s decision to abandon
traditional Marxist-Leninist aspects of its platform so as to better
ally itself with the Socialist Party. Though Althusser’s position was
well publicized and found its supporters, in the end, his arguments
were unable to motivate the Party’s rank-and-file such that its
leadership would reconsider its decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

During the decades in which he became internationally known for his
re-thinking of Marxist philosophy, Althusser continued in his post at
the ENS. There he took on increasing institutional responsibility
while continuing to edit and, with François Maspero, to publish
his own work and that of others in the
series &lt;em&gt;Théorie&lt;/em&gt;. In 1975, Althusser acquired the right
to direct research on the basis of his previously published
work. Shortly after this recognition, he married his longtime
companion, Hélène Rytman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Following the French Left’s and the Communist Party’s
electoral defeats in the 1978 elections, Althusser’s bouts of depression
became more severe and more frequent. In November
1980, after a painful surgery and another
bout of mental illness, which saw him hospitalized for most of the
summer and whose symptoms continued after his return to the ENS in the
fall, Althusser strangled his wife. Before he could be arrested for the
murder, he was sent to a mental hospital. Later, when an
examining magistrate came to inform him of the crime of which he was
accused, Althusser was in so fragile a mental state that he could not
understand the charges or the process to which he was to be submitted
and he was left at the hospital. After an examination, a panel of
psychiatrists concluded that Althusser was suffering at the time of the
murder from severe depression and iatrogenic hallucinations. Citing a
French law (since changed), which states that “there is neither
crime nor delict where the suspect was in a state of dementia at the
time of the action,” the magistrate in charge of
Althusser’s case decided that there were no grounds on which to
pursue prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The last ten years of Althusser’s life were spent in and out of
mental hospitals and at the apartment in Paris’ 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;
arrondissement where he had planned to retire. During this period, he
was visited by a few loyal friends and kept up some correspondences.
Given his mental state, his frequent institutionalizations, his anomie,
and the drugs he was prescribed, these were not very productive years.
However, at mid-decade, he did find the energy to re-visit some of his
old work and to attempt to construct from it an explicit metaphysics.
He also managed to write an autobiography, a text he averred was
intended to provide the explanation for the murder of his wife that he
was never able to provide in court. Both texts only appeared
posthumously. When his mental and physical health deteriorated again in
1987, Althusser went to live at a psychiatric hospital in La
Verrière, a village to the west of Paris. There, on the
22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; of October, 1990, he died of a heart attack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="EarWor194"&gt;2. Early Work (1946–60)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Despite its being anthologized and translated during the mid 1990s,
there has until recently been relatively little critical attention
paid to Althusser’s writings prior to 1961. Certainly, in terms of
method, style, and inspiration, the Althusser found in these works
differs significantly from the Althusser of &lt;em&gt;For Marx&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;Reading Capital&lt;/em&gt;. In his writings from the 1940s, for
instance, his method and conclusions resemble those of the Marxist
Humanists of whom he would later be so critical, while texts from the
1950s deploy without irony the Stalinist shibboleths he would later
subject to such castigation. Nonetheless, as these texts announce many
of Althusser’s perennial themes and because some of the contradictions
these works possess are shared with his classic texts and are repeated
again in his late work, these early essays, books, and translations
are worthy of examination&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="ChrMar"&gt;2.1 Christianity and Marxism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Althusser’s philosophical output between 1946 and 1961 can
roughly be divided into four categories. The first category includes
those essays, mostly written between 1946 and 1951, where Althusser
explores possible rapports between Christianity and Marxism. In the
first of these essays “The International of Decent
Feelings,” Althusser argues from what he takes to be “the
truth of Christianity” against the popular post-war view that the
misery, guilt, and alienation of the human condition in the atomic age
is equally experienced by all subjects. For him, this existentialist
diagnosis is a type of idolatry: it replaces recognition of our
equality before God with our equality before the fear of death. In that
it does so, it is twice anti-Christian. For, in addition to the sin of
idolatry (death equals God), it fails to acknowledge the existence of a
particular class, the proletariat, for whom anguish is not its lot and
who is actually capable of delivering the emancipation from fear by
re-appropriating the products of human production, including the atomic
bomb. A subsequent essay from 1947, “A Matter of Fact,”
continues in this vein, suggesting the necessity of socialist means for
realizing Christian ends. It also includes a Hegelian critique of the
existing Catholic Church which suggests that the church is incapable of
such an alliance without a theological revolution. Each of these
essays includes the suggestion that critique and reform will
occasion a better church and a truer Christianity. By 1949, however,
Althusser was totally pessimistic about this possibility and, in a
letter to his mentor Jean Lacroix, he argued that the sole possibility
for realizing Christian values is through communist action. Though some
critics have argued that Christian and Catholic values and modes of
reasoning inform all of Althusser’s philosophy, any explicit
consideration of a practical and theoretical reconciliation between the
two was abandoned at this point in Althusser’s development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="HegMar"&gt;2.2 Hegelian Marxism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The second category of Althusser’s early work, one closely
related to the first, are those texts that deal with Hegel. Written
primarily for an academic audience, they approach Hegel’s
philosophy either critically, in terms of the history of its reception
and use, or exegetically, in terms of examining what possibility
Hegel’s metaphysics, logic, politics, epistemology, and
understanding of subjectivity offer to those interested in
understanding and encouraging societal transformation. Between 1946 and
1950, the results of Althusser’s exegeses were positive: Hegel
indeed had something to offer. This judgment finds its most detailed
explanation in Althusser’s 1947 thesis “On Content in the
thought of G.W.F. Hegel.”  In addition to
detailing Hegel’s relation to Kant and criticizing the
simplification of the dialectic by Hegel’s commentators,
Althusser argues in this work that the dialectic “cannot be
attacked for its form” (1947, 116). Instead, Hegel can only be
critiqued for a failure of the contents of the form (as these contents
are specified in Hegel’s historical and political works) to have
actually fulfilled the absolute idea. Following the Young Hegelians,
then, Althusser uses Hegel’s dialectic against itself to
criticize claims like the one made in &lt;em&gt;The Philosophy of Right&lt;/em&gt;
that the Prussian state is the fulfillment of the dialectic. Though he
uses Marx’s &lt;em&gt;Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of
Right&lt;/em&gt; to make his points and though he is in agreement with Marx
that the Hegelian concept, realized in thought, must now be realized in
the world, Althusser does not suggest in his thesis that
Marx’s philosophy leaves Hegel’s insights about, history,
logic, and the subject behind. Instead, he contends
that Marx is guilty of committing the same error as Hegel in mistaking
historical content for the fulfillment of the dialectic. Because all
knowledge is historical, Althusser argues, Marxists can only correct
for this error by appeal to the idea of the dialectic and to its end in
the absolute and the eternal, to a time “when the human totality
will be reconciled with its own structure” (1947, 156). Something
like this argument will appear again in his classical work as a
critique of the empiricist tendency in Marxist philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="MarNotHeg"&gt;2.3 Marx not Hegel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

By the early 1950s, Althusser’s judgments that Marxism was, of
necessity, Hegelian and that it aimed at human fulfillment had
undergone revision. This transition to thinking about Marx as the
originator of a philosophy totally distinct from Hegel’s was signaled
in a review essay from 1950 which argued that the post-war mania for
Hegel in France was only a bourgeois attempt to combat Marx.  In two
short essays from 1953 on Marxist philosophy, this switch is fully
apparent. In these texts, Althusser aligns himself with the position
advanced by Mehring and Lenin that, at a certain point in Marx’s
development, Hegel is left behind and that, afterwards, Marx forged
his own original concepts and methodology. In his description of what
these concepts and methodology are, Althusser pretty much follows the
Party line, insisting that Marx reversed the Hegelian dialectic, that
historical materialism is a science, that the sciences verify
dialectical materialism, and that the proletariat needs to be taught
Marxist science from above. Though these essays repeat the Party
philosophy as formulated by Lenin, Stalin, and Zhdanov, they also
include recognizable Althusserian themes and show his thinking about
these themes to be in transition. For instance, both essays retain the
idea from Althusser’s 1947 thesis about the quasi-transcendental
status of present scientific knowledge. Both also anticipate future
concerns in their speculations about the ideological character of
current scientific knowledge and in their incorporation of ideas from
Mao about the relationship between theory and practice. Written as a
response to Paul Ricoeur and representing the last example of this
third category of Althusser’s early work, a text from 1955 argues for
the objectivity of historical science. This is a theme to which he
would return. Noticeably absent from this body of work, however, are
the detailed and original claims Althusser would make in the early
1960s about Marx’s philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="HisWorMonFeu"&gt;2.4 Historical Work: Montesquieu and Feuerbach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Two essays that Althusser wrote in the mid 1950s were the first to
focus exclusively on Marxist philosophy and are interesting inasmuch
as they evidence his rejection of Hegel and his embrace of the
Party’s Marxism-Leninism. In addition, these texts suggest the
need for a thorough study of Marx. This study, however, would wait
until the beginning of the next decade. For the rest of the 1950s,
most of Althusser’s published work involved the study of
philosophical figures who preceded Marx. These figures included
Montesquieu, on whose political philosophy and theory of history he
wrote a book-length study, and Feuerbach, whose writings he translated
and commented upon.  The dual thesis of Althusser’s Montesquieu
book: that, insofar as Montesquieu studies the “concrete
behavior of men” he resists idealism and inaugurates the study
of history as a science and that, insofar as Montesquieu accepts past
and present political formations as delimiting the possibilities for
political life, he remains an idealist, is one that will find echoes
in Althusser’s study of Marx during the next decade. Similarly,
inasmuch as he makes the argument in a commentary (1960) that part of
his intention in translating Feuerbach is to show just what Marx owes
in his early writings to the author of &lt;em&gt;The Essence of
Christianity&lt;/em&gt; so that these may be better seen as absent from
Marx’s mature work, these studies of Feuerbach can also be seen
as propaedeutic to the study of Marx which Althusser inaugurated in
1961 with his article “On the Young Marx”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="ClaWor196"&gt;3. Classic Work (1961–1966)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

With the perspective afforded by the mass of posthumous writings
published since the 1990s, it has become clear that Althusser was
perennially concerned with important issues in metaphysics,
epistemology, philosophy of science, historiography, hermeneutics, and
political philosophy. However, it is also true that the primary medium
Althusser employed for thinking through problems in these areas was
Marxist philosophy. This is especially true of the period between 1961
and 1966 when the majority of his published and unpublished work
concerned itself with how to read Marx, the definition of Marxist
philosophy, and how to understand and apply Marxian concepts. In
addition, if we are to take Althusser’s retrospective word for
it, the pieces he published during this period were intended as
political-theoretical acts, polemics meant to respond to contemporary
opinions and policies and to shift the terms of these arguments as well
as the actions which were their results. For these reasons, it is
natural when discussing these texts to focus upon the contexts that
engendered them and upon the positions within Marxist philosophy that
Althusser stakes out by their means. Alternatively, as Althusser
indicates in many of these pieces his debts to contemporaneous
theorists and to philosophical predecessors such as Spinoza, there is
the temptation to understand his thought as a combination of the
insights contributed by these thinkers with Marxist philosophy. While
each is a useful approach to understanding and explaining
Althusser’s philosophy, when excessive attention is paid to one
or another of them, one risks historicizing his contributions or
suggesting that they are merely derivative. Seeking to avoid either
result, even though the following discussion will note the context for
Althusser’s work, its relation to Marxist philosophy, and the
non-Marxist philosophical insights that contribute to its method and
conclusions, this account will also suggest the uniqueness of his
contributions to hermeneutics, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of
science, historiography, and political philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

For multiple, overlapping, and complicated reasons of which the most
relevant may be the discrediting of Stalin’s personage, policies,
and version of Marxist philosophy that followed Khrushchev’s
“Secret Speech,” Europe in the late 1950s
saw a blossoming of political and philosophical alternatives to the
version of Marxism-Leninism promulgated by the Soviet Union. This
version of Marxist philosophy had dominated European leftist thought
and action since the dawn of the Cold War in 1947 and, in France, was
widely disseminated via Communist Party schools and literature. While
political and philosophical change were slow to occur in the French
Communist Party, by the late 1950s, many intellectuals associated with
the Party began to ask questions about what constitutes the core of
Marx’s philosophy and about how this philosophy guides, relates
to, or allows for political action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

For many of these intellectuals, answering this question meant a
return to Marx’s early work (those texts written before 1845) in
the hopes of finding the “key” to his philosophy. In pieces
like “Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of
Right” (1844), and the &lt;em&gt;Economic and Philosophic
Manuscripts&lt;/em&gt; (1844), these thinkers found and championed a Marx
obviously indebted to a Hegelian dialectical understanding of
subjectivity and historical development and deeply concerned about
ending human alienation. It is to this project—that of finding
the true method, aim, and intent of Marx’s philosophy in his
early work’s emphasis on the realization of full human freedom
and potentials through dialectical historical change—that
Althusser made the first of his public “interventions” into
Marxist philosophy. He inaugurated this effort with the essay “On
the Young Marx” (1961), which sought to demonstrate that this
method of looking to Marx’s early work for the key to his
philosophy was methodologically suspect and ideologically driven.
Further, in this essay and in subsequent work, he developed an
alternate method of investigation or “reading” that would
allow Marx’s true philosophy to be revealed in its purity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

From the fruits of this new method of reading, Althusser argued that
not only was Marx the originator of a new philosophy, Dialectical
Materialism, that had nothing to do with its Hegelian and Feuerbachian
predecessors, but that he also founded a new science, Historical
Materialism, which broke with and superseded such ideological and
pre-scientific precursors as the political economics of Smith and
Ricardo. For the most part, the essays collected in &lt;em&gt;For Marx&lt;/em&gt;
(1965) and the seminar papers issued as &lt;em&gt;Reading Capital&lt;/em&gt; (1965)
develop and utilize this method of reading in order to justify and
describe Marxist philosophy and Marxist science as well as to
distinguish between these two theoretical activities. In so doing,
Althusser says quite a bit about the nature of knowledge and the
general relations between philosophy, science, politics, and ideology.
Further, Althusser applies this hermeneutic method to argue against
what he labeled “empiricist” understandings of Marx. These
included the Humanist interpretations of Marx described above as well
as variations on the orthodox Marxist-Leninist theory, which specified
the strict determination of culture and history by the existing modes
of economic exchange and resulting class struggles. The following
paragraphs discuss this theory of reading, how it produces a different
understanding of Marx’s philosophy than that which is derived
from Humanist and Economist readings, and how it informs his
epistemology, philosophy of science, historiography, and political
philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="HerThe"&gt;3.1 Hermeneutic Theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The label that Althusser gave to the method by which he approached
Marx’s texts was that of a “symptomatic reading.”
Instead of looking back at Marx’s early work in order to find the
“essence” of his philosophy, one of whose expressions was
&lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt;, and also instead of trying to build a true or
consistent theory out of Marx’s oeuvre by explaining away
contradictions within it and noting certain passages as key, Althusser
argued that Marx’s true philosophy was largely absent from his
work prior to 1845. Even in mature texts such as &lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt;,
Althusser maintained that Marx’s philosophy remained largely
implicit, as the background system of concepts which allowed the
scientific work Marx was involved in generating to take place. The
symptomatic method of reading was designed to make these concepts
explicit and “to establish the indispensable minimum for the
consistent existence of Marxist philosophy&lt;strong&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt;
(1965a [2005], 35).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The three inspirations Althusser gave for this interpretive method
were those provided by Spinoza, Freud by way of Lacan, and that
provided by Marx himself. In addition, he added to these examples
insights from the French tradition of historical epistemology about the
way in which sciences come to be constituted. One of the ideas borrowed
from Spinoza was the contention that texts and authors are the products
of their times and that the thoughts authors set down on the page
cannot help but be a part of, and be affected by, the ideological
currents that accompany and allow for the satisfaction of needs in a
specific era. So then, similar to the way in which Spinoza argued in
the &lt;em&gt;Theological Political-Treatise&lt;/em&gt; that by engaging in a
materialist historical study of the Bible one could disentangle those
prophetic laws and commands which were merely the result of temporal
exigencies and the prophet’s imagination from those which
represented the true word of God, so Althusser argued that one could
disentangle those concepts which were merely ideological in
Marx’s texts from those which comprised his true philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Though this theory was later to be complicated and revised, during
this period, Althusser consistently argued that Marx’s work prior to
1845 was ideological and that it was saturated with non-Marxian
concepts borrowed from Hegel’s and Feuerbach’s philosophical
anthropologies. Althusser did recognize that some of Marx’s early work
is marked by its rejection of idealist premises and concepts. However,
inasmuch as this early work was seen to espouse a telic view of
humanity in which the individual and society was said to undergo a
necessary historico-dialectical development, Althusser identified it
as fundamentally Hegelian. That there was a materialist correction to
this basic narrative with Marx’s embrace of Feuerbach, Althusser also
granted. However, the replacement by Marx of a speculative
anthropology which saw the historical development of society as the
self-fulfillment of human freedom with a materialist anthropology that
cited the same logic of development but which specified that the motor
of this development was human beings in their “sensuous life
activity,” was seen by Althusser to represent little conceptual
and no logical advance from Hegel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

This “theory of the break,” which held that Marx’s early
work was Hegelian and ideological and that, after a decisive rupture
in 1845 and then a long period of transition between 1845–1857,
his work became recognizably Marxist and scientific, would seem to
indicate that all one has to do to understand Marx’s philosophy is to
read this mature work. However, the actual case is not so
simple. While reading &lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt; and other late works is
necessary for understanding Marx’s philosophy, it is not
sufficient. It is not sufficient, Althusser argued, because, even in
his post-1857 writings, Marx provides no systematic exposition of his
epistemology or his ideas about social structure, history, and human
nature, all of which were necessary for Marxist philosophy’s
consistent and continuing existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Many interpreters of Marx, and not just those Althusser directly
engaged with during the early 1960s, have maintained that such texts as
the &lt;em&gt;1859 Preface&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;1844 Manuscripts&lt;/em&gt; provide
keys to understanding Marx’s philosophy. However, Althusser made
the case that these texts were contradictory and insufficient for this
purpose. It is with this contention that the models provided by
psychoanalysis and by Marx’s own critique of classical political
economy come to inform Althusser’s overall hermeneutic strategy.
Part of this strategy, Althusser maintains, is directly taken from
Marx’s own method. Thus, in a way parallel to Marx pointing out
in &lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt; V.II (1885) that Adam Smith needed the concept of
the “value of labor” for his explanations of capitalist
economic activity but could not fully generate it out of the systems of
ideas available to him, Althusser argued that, though Marx was
recognizably engaged in the work of Historical Materialism in
&lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt;, the philosophical theory or background conceptual
framework that allowed this investigation to proceed was not fully
articulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The explicit project of &lt;em&gt;Reading Capital&lt;/em&gt; and of many of the
essays included in &lt;em&gt;For Marx&lt;/em&gt; was to make these fundamental
concepts explicit. It was to do so by paying attention to the
theoretical “problematic,” or background ideological
framework in which the work was generated, by analyzing those passages
where a philosophical concept had to have been in use but was not made
explicit, and by noting and explaining where and why one theoretical
pronouncement is in contradiction with itself or with another passage.
For Althusser, such areas of Marx’s text are “symptoms,”
in the psychoanalytic sense of the word, of the necessary but
unarticulated philosophical framework that underwrites and allows his
scientific investigations. Of these frameworks, Marx was not fully
conscious. However, they were what allowed him to investigate and
describe such socio-economic events as the transformation of money
into capital without recourse to Hegelian logic and
concepts. Althusser argues that by paying attention to these passages
in Marx’s text as well as by seeking out Marxist concepts as these
were developed during the course of practical Marxist activity by
theorists such as Lenin and Mao, an attentive reader can render
explicit Marx’s philosophy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

That the concepts Althusser derived from his symptomatic reading of
Marx, Lenin, and Mao were Marxist concepts was avowed. Nevertheless,
Althusser also acknowledged that some of the concepts found latent in
these texts were derived from and consistent with his philosophical
and social scientific contemporaries as well as with those of
Spinoza. Of course, this is not inconsistent with the theory of
reading and authorship that underwrites a symptomatic reading of a
text. Inasmuch as authors and readers are always said to think with
concepts borrowed from or supplied by the problematic that they
inhabit, there is no such thing as an innocent or objective reading:
we understand things with and through the concepts available to us.
Perhaps nowhere is this borrowing more evident than in Althusser’s
ideas about how scientific and philosophic knowledge is
generated. Though Althusser is very careful to back up his arguments
about Marx’s epistemology with close analyses of Marx’s work, it is
apparent that the model for knowledge acquisition that is developed
in &lt;em&gt;Reading Capital&lt;/em&gt; owes much to Spinoza and to the French
tradition of historical epistemology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="EpiSci"&gt;3.2 Epistemology and Philosophy of Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

With his re-reading of Marx, Althusser wished to offer an
alternative to the two then dominant understandings of Marx’s
philosophy. Both understandings were charged with the same mistake.
This mistake was, fundamentally, an epistemological one: each cast Marx
as an empiricist. At first glance, this charge might seem ridiculous.
This is especially the case as, according to Althusser’s own
critique, both understandings of Marx offered variants of the Hegelian
claim that there is a reason to history. For Althusser, however, both
readings were “empiricist” inasmuch as each ascribed to
Marx a theory of knowledge in which the subject, by means of a process
of observation and abstraction, comes to know what an object really and
truly is, according to its essence. This is a definition of empiricism
meant to include philosophers as diverse as Locke, Kant, and Hegel and
traditions as varied as British Empiricism, German Idealism,
Positivism, and Pragmatism. In the case of Humanist Marxism, the object
that comes to be known by its essence is the human subject in its full
freedom. It does so by means of critique and by creatively overcoming
that which is alien to it or “merely historical.” In
the case of orthodox Marxism-Leninism, this object is the economy, the
reality that underlies, causes, and can explain all historical
structures and transformations. The economy comes to be known as it
truly is only by the proletariat, by those whom the historical process
has endowed with an objective gaze and who possess the ability to make
this truth objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

In opposition to the empiricist model of knowledge production,
Althusser proposes that true or scientific knowledge is distinguished
from ideology or opinion not by dint of an historical subject having
abstracted the essence of an object from its appearances. Instead, this
knowledge is understood to be produced by a process internal to
scientific knowledge itself. Though this transformation takes place
entirely in thought, Althusser does not maintain that scientific
knowledge makes no use of facts. However, these facts or materials are
never brute. Rather, specific sciences start with pre-existing concepts
or genera such as “humors,” “unemployment,”
“quasars,” or “irrational numbers.” These
genera may be ideological in part or in whole. Science’s job is
to render these concepts scientific. This labor is what Althusser terms
“theoretical practice.” The result of this practice is
scientific knowledge. Scientific knowledge is produced by means of
applying to these genera the body of concepts or “theory”
that the science possesses for understanding them. This body of
concepts may be more or less unified and consistent and it may be more
or less consciously articulated. Further, the sum of the individual
concepts that this theory consists of delimits the possible ways in
which the genera that a science begins with can be understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

When applied, a science’s theory weeds out ideological notions
associated with the original concept or genera. The result of this
application of theory to genera is the transformation of the
“ideological generality into a scientific generality”
(1963b [2005], 185). An example of such a process is the
transformation in medical science of a concept like “phlegmatic
humors” into the idea of blood-borne pathogens by dint of the
theory of circulation and infectious disease. Once generated, such
scientific concepts inform regular scientific practice, allowing
specific research programs within an individual science to
progress. Althusser himself gives examples of three such major
transformations. The first is the founding of modern physics by
Galileo, the other that of Greek mathematics, and the third, that of
Marx’s founding of the science of Historical Materialism out of
Classical Political Economy. Each of these foundings is marked by what
Althusser terms an “epistemological break,” or a period
when ideological concepts are replaced by scientific ones. Any
similarity here to Kuhnian ideas about revolutionary and normal
science is not surprising. Both Canguilhem and Bachelard, from whom
Althusser drew inspiration for his theory, were part of a dialogue
that took in the work of Alexander Koyré on scientific
revolutions, a thinker from whom Kuhn, in turn, drew his
inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Althusser’s debt to the tradition of French historical
epistemology in this account of knowledge production and philosophy of
science should now be evident. However, this epistemology’s
Marxian and Spinozistic elements may be less pronounced. The vocabulary
adopted above to express this theory, however, gestures to both
influences. For Althusser, Marx’s founding of the science of
history is crucial not only to politics (as will be addressed below)
but also to understanding all of human activity, including scientific
activity. That there is a circular logic to this epistemological
theory, Althusser readily admits, for it is only the science of
Historical Materialism that allows us to understand scientific practice
in general. Althusser, though, is comfortable with this circularity.
This is because, insofar as this understanding of scientific practice
in general allows us to understand how individual sciences produce
their knowledge, Historical Materialism is a science that functions
like any other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

For Althusser, the concept that helps to produce this understanding
of scientific practices is that of the “mode of
production.” With it, he argues, Marx supplied theorists
with an idea sufficient to comprehend the way in which we materially
produce our selves, our environments, our knowledges, and our
histories. Indeed, this concept makes it possible to analyze all of our
activities in their specificity and to understand them in their
relation to the totality of which they are a part. As it must be if we
are to make sense of scientific practice as one aspect of the total
mode of production, much more than the activity of economic production
must be included in this totality of productive practices. Added by
Althusser to these two aspects of the mode of production are those of
ideological, political, and philosophical production, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

In each of the practices that together comprise, at any given time, a
specific mode of production, some form or forms of labor uses the existing means
of production to transform existing materials into new products.
According to Althusser, this realization is Marx’s basic insight.
In scientific production, for example, thinkers use existing theories
to transform existing concepts into new, scientific concepts. However,
and this is where Althusser’s Spinozism becomes apparent and also
where he breaks with economistic understandings of Marx, it is not the
case that the analysis of any one mode of production within the
totality of productive practices is capable of generating an
understanding of the way in which all rest of the productive processes
are causally determined. Rather, and in line with the parallelism
attributed by Leibniz to Spinoza, as each productive process transforms
a unique material (concepts in science, goods in economics, social
relations in politics), each process can only be understood in terms of
its unique causal structure. In addition, and again also in a way
similar to Spinoza’s account of substance as seen from different
aspects, each productive process is understood to stand in relation to
and play a part of a complexly structured whole, none of which is
reducible to being the simple or essential cause of the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

That Althusser regards most, if not all, human activity as consisting
of material processes of production and reproduction can be used as a
key to understanding other parts of his philosophy. These include his
thoughts on the structure of the social and political world, the
historical process, and philosophy. As philosophy is closely related to
science and because it is charged with a task that allows the
production of knowledge about the other socio-economic practices to be
generated, it is probably best to start with Althusser’s
understanding of philosophy as a material practice of production before
proceeding to a discussion of how Althusser understands the other
practices listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="Rol"&gt;3.3 The Role of Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

According to Althusser, most activity labeled
“philosophy” is really a type of ideological production. By
this, he means to say that most philosophy reproduces, in highly
abstract form, notions about the world whose effect is to sustain
existing socio-economic relations. As such, philosophy merely reflects
the background values, attitudes, and ideas that allow the
socio-economic world to function. However, for Althusser, genuine
philosophy functions as a “Theory of theoretical practice”
(1965b). In this mode, it works to provide an aid to scientific
practice by distinguishing between ideological concepts and scientific
ones as well as by clarifying and rendering consistent the scientific
concepts that enable a science to transforms existing
ideas into scientific knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

For Althusser, it is not necessary that this process of distinction
and clarification be accomplished before a specific theoretical
practice can generate scientific knowledge. In fact, scientific
activity often proceeds without a clear understanding of the concepts
that allow it to produce its knowledge. Indeed, Althusser maintained
that this was Marx’s lot when he was writing &lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt;:
scientific knowledge of the capitalist economic system was being
produced, but Marx did not possess a full awareness of the concepts
allowing this production. According to this definition of philosophy as
the Theory of theoretical practice, Althusser’s re-reading of
&lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt; and other texts was philosophical insofar as it was
able to name and distinguish the concepts that allowed Marx’s
scientific analysis of history to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="Mar"&gt;3.4 Marxist Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The latent concepts rendered explicit by the practice of symptomatic
reading were said by Althusser to constitute the theory of Dialectical
Materialism, or what is the same thing, Marx’s philosophy. With
these concepts made explicit, Althusser believed that Marxist science,
or Historical Materialism, could employ them in order to achieve better
analyses of specific modes of production and better understandings of
the opportunities that specific modes of production presented for
political change. Some of these concepts have already been articulated
in the discussion of the mode of production above, but without being
named. To label these concepts and then to add some more, the idea that
each individual productive process or element stands in relation to and
plays a part of a complexly structured whole, none of which is
reducible to being the simple or essential cause of the others, is what
Althusser terms the idea of “structural causality.”
This concept, in turn, is closely related to the idea of
“overdetermination” or the theory that every element in the
total productive process constituting a historical moment is determined
by all the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Another Marxist philosophical concept that allows the historical
materialist scientist to understand the logic of a specific mode of
production is that of “contradiction.” This is the
idea that, at any given period, multiple, concrete and definite
practices take place within a mode of production. Among and within
these specific practices, there may or may not be tensions. 
To take an example from Marx’s chapter on
“Primitive Accumulation” in &lt;em&gt;Capital V.I&lt;/em&gt;, at the
same time as peasants holdings were being expropriated in the late
15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and early 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries by a nascent
bourgeoisie, the church and the aristocracy were passing laws against
this appropriation. Any isolable element of the total structure, be it
a person, a social class, an institution, or the state, in some way
reflects and embodies these practices and these antagonisms and as such
each is said to be “overdetermined.” Further,
Althusser specifies that the development of productive practices within
a specific mode of production is often “uneven” in addition
to possibly being antagonistic. This means, for instance, that some
economic elements within a whole may be more or less capitalistic while
others simultaneously operate according to socialist norms. Thus the
development within a mode of production of the practices specific to it
is not necessarily homogenous or linear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Added to the Marxian concepts of structural causality,
contradiction, uneven development, and overdetermination is that of the
“structure in dominance.” This concept designates
that major element in a structural whole that tends to organize all of
the other practices. In much of the contemporary world and inasmuch as
it tends to organize the production of moral values, scientific
knowledge, the family, art, etc. this structure is the economic
practice of commodity production and consumption. However, in another
era and in other places, it may be the production and dissemination of
religious beliefs and practices that dominates and organizes the socio-economic
structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="SocPolHis"&gt;3.5 Social and Political Philosophy, Historiography&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With this understanding of the elements that compose any
socio-economic structure and their relations made explicit, something
can now be said about the social and political philosophies that
follow from it. First, with the idea that human individuals are merely
one of the sites at which the contradictory productive forces that
characterize an era are enacted, Althusser signals that the primary
object of social philosophy is not the human individual. Second, with
the idea that the state produced by political activity is merely one
productive process among others, Althusser signals that the primary
element in political philosophy is not the state. Though both states
and individuals are important elements of the socio-economic whole,
nothing philosophical is learned by examining the essence of the
individual or the way in which justice is embodied by the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

As Althusser understands them, whatever conceptions we have of the
nature of human beings or about the proper function of the state are
historically generated and serve to reproduce existing social
relations. In other words, they are ideological. Apart from the
necessity of human beings to engage in productive relations with other
human beings and with their environment in order to produce their means
of subsistence, there is no human nature or essence. This is the core
of Althusser’s “anti-humanist” position. Further,
though some order must exist in order to allow for the production and
reproduction of social life, there is no essential or best form that
this order must take. This is not to say that human beings do not
conceive of or strive for the best order for social life or that they
do not believe that they are essentially free or equal and deserving
of rights. It also does not mean that all of our ideas are homogenous
and that heterogeneous ideas about what is best cannot exist side by
side in the same system without leading to conflict (though they
sometimes do). However, the science of Historical Materialism has
revealed the desire for such orders to be historically generated along
with the ideas about human nature that justify them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

This account of the ideological role of our conceptions of human
nature and of the best political arrangement shows Althusser to differ
little from interpretations of Marx which hold that political
ideologies are the product of and serve existing economic relations.
However, and as was detailed above, Althusser rejects the simple
understanding of causality offered by this model in which economic
practices order consciousness and our cultural practices. He also
rejects the philosophy of history that often accompanies this model.
This philosophy has it that certain economic practices not only
generate corresponding cultural practices, but that there is a pattern
to economic development in which each economic order inexorably leads to
its own demise and replacement by a different economic system. In this
understanding of history, feudalism must lead to capitalism and
capitalism to socialism. Althusser, however, argues against the idea
that history has a subject (such as the economy or human agency)
and that history has a goal (such as communism or human freedom).
History, for Althusser, is a process without a subject. There are
patterns and orders to historical life and there is historical change.
However, there is no necessity to any of these transformations and
history does not necessarily progress. Transformations do occur.
However, they do so only when the contradictions and levels of
development inherent in a mode of production allow for such change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="Rev196"&gt;4. Revisions (1966–78)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

From the time of its initial dissemination, Althusser’s
re-reading of Marx was met by almost equal amounts of enthusiasm and
castigation. For every reader who found in his prose an explanation of
Marx’s philosophy and science that rendered Marx philosophically
respectable and offered renewed hope for Marxist theory, there were
critics who judged his work to be idealist, Stalinist, dogmatist, or
excessively structuralist, among myriad other charges. Though many of
the initial reactions were contradictory and evidenced
misunderstandings of what Althusser was up to, compelling criticisms
were also offered. One was that Althusser was only able to offer his
reading by ignoring much of what Marx actually wrote about his logic
and about the concepts important to his analysis. Another criticism,
and one voiced to Althusser by leaders of the French Communist Party,
was that Althusser’s reading of Marx offered little on the
relationship between Marxist theory and Marxist political practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

It took a long time before Althusser explicitly addressed the charge
that he had ignored much of what Marx had to say about his own logic
and concepts. However, buffeted by these criticisms and with a sense
that there were idealist or “theoreticist” tendencies in
his reading of Marx and that the relationship between theory and
practice was indeed under-developed, Althusser set out during the late
1960s and 1970s to correct and revise his take on the relationships
among philosophy, science, ideology, and politics. To some readers,
these revisions represented a politically motivated betrayal of his
theoretical accomplishments. For others, they simply revealed his
project as a whole to be untenable and self-contradictory. Some recent
critics, however, have argued that these revisions are consistent with
and necessary to the development of what they view to be the overall
goal of Althusser’s work: the development of a materialist
political philosophy adequate for political practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="RelBetThePra"&gt;4.1 The Relationship between Theory and Practice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Althusser’s initial revisions to his understanding of the social
structure and knowledge production were informed by a renewed
attention to the works of Lenin and by a seminar he convened at the
ENS in 1967 for leading scientists and interested students. This
course resulted in a series of papers, gathered together
as &lt;em&gt;Philosophy and the Spontaneous Philosophy of the
Scientists&lt;/em&gt; (1967a), in which Althusser began rethinking the
relations among philosophy, science, ideology, and politics. Though
this revision was later to be made more explicit, one of the most
striking aspects of these papers was Althusser’s abandonment of the
Spinozistic claim that the different levels of theoretical practice
were autonomous. He now maintained that there was no criterion
sufficient to demarcate scientific from ideological concepts and that
all theoretical concepts are marked by ideology. This did not mean,
however, that any concept was as good as any other.  Scientists,
through their work on the material real, tended to generate better
understandings of things than were available intuitively.  Further, he
argued that philosophy still had a role to play in the clarification
of scientific concepts. This is the case because, no matter how much
work scientists do to understand the material real and to generate
better concepts, they must always employ ideological concepts to frame
their investigations and its results. Marxist philosophers, he
maintained, could be useful to scientists by pointing out, from the
standpoint of politics and by the method of historical critique, where
and how some of the concepts scientists employed were ideological. The
result of this intervention of philosophy into politics would not be
“truer” concepts, but ideas that were more
“correct” or “right” in both the normative and
positive senses of these words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Parallel to this move, and motivated by the need to provide the link
between philosophical theory and political practice that was largely
missing from his classic work, Althusser now argued that philosophy had
a useful role to play between politics and science. Political practice,
Althusser maintained, was mostly motivated by ideological
understandings of what the good is and how to accomplish it. Though he
did not argue that there was a way to leave ideology behind and to
reveal the good in itself, he did maintain that science could help to
correct ideological thinking about political means and ends. Social
science in particular could do so by showing how certain goals were
impossible or misguided given present socio-economic relations and by
suggesting that, at a certain time and in a certain place, other means
and other ends might be more fruitfully adopted and pursued. As
scientific knowledge does not speak directly to the public or to
politicians, Althusser assigned materialist philosophers the job of
communicating scientific knowledge of the material real, its
conditions, and its possibilities to politicians and the public. If
this communication is successful, Althusser maintained, one should not
expect all political activity to be successful. Instead, one should
expect a modest shift from an idealist ideology to one that is
materialist and more scientific and which has a better chance of
realizing its goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="TheIde"&gt;4.2 Theory of Ideology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

During the 1970s, Althusser continued the revisions begun in 1967 and
elaborated other Marxian ideas he believed to be
underdeveloped. Perhaps the best known of the new conceptual
formulations resulting from these efforts is that of
“ideological interpellation.” This account of how a human
being becomes a self-conscious subject was published in an essay
titled “Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses”
(1970). It was excerpted from a larger essay titled “On
the Reproduction of Capitalism.” This work analyzed the
necessary relationship between state and subject such that a given
economic mode of production might subsist. It includes not only an
analysis of the state and its legal and educational systems but also
of the psychological relationship which exists between subject and
state as ideology. This narrative of subjectification was intended to
help advance Althusser’s argument that regimes or states are able to
maintain control by reproducing subjects who believe that their
position within the social structure is a natural one.  Ideology, or
the background ideas that we possess about the way in which the world
must function and of how we function within it is, in this account,
understood to be always present. Specific socio-economic structures,
however, require particular ideologies. These ideologies are
instantiated by institutions or “Ideological State
Apparatuses” like family, schools, church, etc., which provide
the developing subject with categories in which she can recognize
herself. Inasmuch as a person does so and embraces the practices
associated with those institutions, she has been successfully
“hailed” or “interpellated” and recognized
herself as that subject who does those kinds of things. As the effect
of these recognitions is to continue existing social relations,
Althusser argued that a Dictatorship of the Proletariat is necessary
so that Ideological State Apparatuses productive of the bourgeois
subject can be replaced with those productive of proletarian or
communist subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="MarRed"&gt;4.3 Marx’s Philosophy Redux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

In 1978 and as a response to what he saw, yet again, as the
theoretical and political misdirection of the Communist movement,
Althusser authored a piece, “Marx in his Limits,” which was
intended to separate the good from the bad in Marx’s philosophy.
In his classic work, Althusser had tried to accomplish this goal by
separating out ideological concepts and by bringing forth the
scientific ones. However, in “Marx in his Limits,” he now
argued that such a method of separation cannot work
because—within Marx’s writings and throughout his
oeuvre—both good and bad, materialist and idealist concepts, are
hopelessly intermixed and many are underdeveloped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Inasmuch as Althusser admits in this piece that Marx never fully
abandoned Hegel’s logic, the concept of human alienation, or the
idea that history has a goal, the inventory Althusser offers can be
seen as a positive response to the charge that he had ignored
Marx’s explicit statements in order to imagine for Marx a
consistent and “true” philosophy. Althusser does not give
up on the task of articulating a better Marxist philosophy, however.
Instead, he argues that there is another, “materialist”
criterion that allows us to see the limits of Marx’s thinking and
to recognize those points in his work where Marx was
unable to transcend his bourgeois background and his education in
German Idealism. This criterion is that of the practical success or
failure of Marx’s concepts as each has been employed in the
history of Marxist movements. When we have affected this inventory and
grouped together the successful concepts, what we are left with is a
materialist Marxism, a Marxism which endorses the scientific method as
the best way for understanding ourselves and our potential but that
also understands that this method is fallible. Remaining also is a
Marxism which does not subscribe to any philosophy of history and which
certainly does not maintain that capitalism will inevitably lead to
communism. This Marxism has no system of interrelated concepts that
guarantee a scientific analysis. Further, it possesses no worked out
theory of the relations between economic structures and cultural
structures but for that limited knowledge which scientific practice
provides. Finally, this Marxism has given up the dream of analyzing the
whole of culture and its movement from the outside; it realizes that
one thinks inside and about the culture one inhabits in order to
possibly effect and change that culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="LatWor198AleMat"&gt;5. Late work (1980–1986): Aleatory Materialism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

After being interrupted by ill health and by the events following
from the murder of his wife, in 1982 Althusser returned to the question
of what was essential to Marx’s philosophy and expanded the scope
of this inquiry to include speculation about the metaphysics that must
underlie it. Freed by his ignoble status from the
task of influencing the direction of the Communist movement, the texts
associated with this project and gathered together in the book
&lt;em&gt;Philosophy of the Encounter&lt;/em&gt; differ tremendously in subject
matter, style, and method from his other writings. Whether these texts
represent a continuation of, or even the key to his philosophy or
whether they are an aberration is presently being debated in the
secondary literature. However, as there is strong textural and archival
evidence that many of the ideas explicitly expressed in these works had
been gestating for a long time, the contention that these writings are
of a piece with his earlier work seems to be gaining ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The principal thesis of Althusser’s last philosophical
writings is that there exists an “underground” or little
recognized tradition in the history of philosophy. Variously labeled a
“materialism of the encounter” or “aleatory
materialism,” the method which he uses to articulate this
philosophy is to simply comment upon works by philosophers who
exemplify this current and to point out where, how, and to what extent
they do so. In addition to Marx, the philosophers that he cites as
being part of this underground tradition include Democritus, Epicurus,
Lucretius, Machiavelli, Spinoza, Hobbes, Rousseau, Montesquieu,
Heidegger, and Wittgenstein. From these readings in the history of
philosophy, Althusser aims to suggest that this tradition exists and
that it is both philosophically fecund and viable. He also wishes to
return to and bolster the thesis he first ventured in the late 1960s
that there are really only two positions in philosophy: materialism and
idealism. As he understood it, the two tendencies are always in a war
of opposition with the one functioning to reinforce the status quo and
the other to possibly overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Perhaps because it functions in opposition to the idealist tendency
in philosophy, aleatory materialism is marked almost as much by its
rejections as it is by the positive claims it contains about the world
and about history. As Marx is included within this tradition, it is not
surprising that many of these rejections are also attributed to him
during the course of Althusser’s earlier work. These include a
dismissal of what Althusser calls “the principle of
Reason,” or the idea that the universe or history has an origin
or an end. With this prohibition, Althusser means to exclude from this
tradition not only the usual suspects in the rationalist tradition, but
also mechanical and dialectical materialisms with their logics of
determination. Also dismissed, he maintains, is the myth that somehow
philosophy and philosophers are autonomous, that they see the world
from outside and objectively. Though there is an objective world,
philosophy does not have knowledge of this world as its object for
there is no way for it to ground itself and the material it thinks with
and through arises historically. Philosophy is therefore not a science
or the Science of sciences and it produces no universal Truth. Rather,
the truths it produces are contingent and are offered in opposition to
other competing truths. If philosophy does have an object, it is the
void, or that which is not yet but which could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

That the philosophy of the encounter lacks an object does not mean
that it lacks positive propositions. However, given the
epistemological status attributed to philosophy by Althusser, these
metaphysical propositions or “theses” are true only insofar
as they have explanatory or practical value. First among them,
following Democritus, is the thesis that matter is all that exists.
Second is the thesis that chance or the aleatory is at the origin of
all worlds. That the patterns which constitute and define these worlds
can be known, described, and predicted according to certain laws or
reasons is also true. However, the fact that these worlds ever came to
be organized in these patterns is aleatory and the patterns themselves can only
ever be known immanently. Third, new worlds and new orders themselves
arise out of chance encounters between pre-existing material elements.
Whether or not such orders emerge is contingent: they do not have to
occur. When material elements collide, they either “take”
and a new order is founded, or they do not and the old world
continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

To Althusser, the propositions which have explanatory value at the
level of ontology and cosmology also have value at the level of
political philosophy. After first citing Rousseau and Hobbes as
example of philosophers who recognized that the origin and continued
existence of political orders is contingent, Althusser turns to
Machiavelli and Marx for his principle examples of how aleatory
materialism functions in the political realm. The anti-teleological,
scientistic, and anti-humanist, Marxist philosophy developed by
Althusser over the course of his career works well with the
materialist metaphysics recounted above. In this understanding of
Marxist philosophy, societies and subjects are seen as patterns of
activity that behave in predictable ways. Though scientists may study
and describe these orders in their specificity, it does not at first
appear that philosophy can do much except to categorize these
interactions at the most general level. However, citing Marx’s
work again and taking inspiration from Machiavelli’s project of
installing “a new prince in a new principality,” Althusser
argues that the materialist philosopher may accomplish somewhat more
than this with her descriptions, critiques, and predictions. This is
because, by examining a political order not from the perspective of
its necessity but with an awareness of its contingency, this
philosopher may be able think the possibility of its
transformation. If chance smiles on her, if someone listens and if
effects occur, then elements might recombine and a new political might
take hold. This is, to be sure, a very limited and unpredictable power
attributed to the philosopher. However, it is also the only one that
Althusser in his late works argues is adequate for political practice
and that does not, like idealism, merely serve to reproduce existing
relations.&lt;/p&gt;
